It was a reply to Gopika Ravikumar's original post. Not to you. The line of it went to you, and when I saw that I tried to change it but my internet connection locked up. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRichard Deeming said, \"Says the person whose only other message on this site is a \"do all my work for me\" question in the database forum.\" That is not nice. That is arrogant.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen when the poster, who seems to think that this is a \"helpful\" site tried to placate Deeming and received, \"But if you turn up and dump a list of requirements and expect us to do all the work for you, you've come to the wrong site.\" More arrogance from Deeming. I do not care how many points he has. That means nothing as he has proven multiple times in degrading other people that are simply asking for help. Maybe I should have contacted the advertisers on this site and pointed out to them how offensive some memebers like Deeming are. Maybe the advertisers will consider that the negativity transfered to readers is also by association transferred to their product. I have been thinking about that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI like your posts, generally. You seem to get flustered by new people's questions occationally, but you do not agressively degrade them. I might some day like to meet you and simply listen to what you have to say in general. Have lunch. Sit and listen. That sounds nice.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut, bullies like Deeming, I have a tendency to get in a bully's face, nose to nose. I would cross a room full of people to stand in the face of a bully. I have always been that way. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou can delete my account if you like. It is OK. I have learned what I mostly came here to learn, which was how to break apart files into bits and analyze them for security purposes. I noticed 7 negative 16's on my reputation history today. I guess that means that I have found a bully and am standing in his face, right where I enjoy being. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou guys depend upon advertising revenue. Think about that. If I am to advertise on your site, then it had better be a lot less negative. I come from heavy industry, where there is a lot more money simply in the cash flow than your tiny advertisers that you have now can pay. CFOs that have MBAs are [supposedly] trained like I was in head to head competitive strategies. Advertising on a negative site can preclude a viewer's tendencies toward disliking or at least feeling uncomfortable with any and all that they encounter (like advertising) while perceiving negativity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBullies or me. If we are together I will be in their face. Deeming is a bully, like some others that I have encountered here.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2022-08-09T10:26:00","modifiedDate":"2022-08-09T10:26:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2022-10-30T11:09:00","rating":1.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5892266/Re-Team-mates-lazy-and-making-me-do-all-the-work","apiLink":"","parentId":5892183,"threadId":5882888,"indentLevel":4},{"id":"5892271","title":"Re: Team mates lazy and making me do all the work","authors":[{"name":"Richard MacCutchan","id":767687}],"summary":"<blockquote class=\"quote\"><div class=\"op\">Member 15078716 wrote:</div>It was not a reply to you.

I thought this would be a better place to put the answer so I am copying and pasting here. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAhhh Lucy code. I worked on a team of three programmers once. It was almost a former lifetime. Two of us wrote fairly decent code. 1. Named Lucy did not. She used Goto statements. She named her variables name1, name2, name3, textbox1, textbox2 etc… It was horrible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe manager loved her however. 1. She was a girl on the team so that helped the powers that be say we are diverse. (whatever. Bad work is bad work). and she could very quickly get a first draft into a persons hands to react to on screens and other things. She was very good at getting a project started. without thinking about the end goal.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nButtttttt and it is a huge one. She would have trouble finishing or modifing anything she worked on. And Brad and I would flat refuse to even look at her code. IF when we were forced too. We informed our manager that it would take a week of clean up before we were ready to even start on the actual changes for improvements. Also, she could not update her own code. She would spend days just trying to figure out what name77 did and what kind of variable it actually was.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt took a very long time. Like a year or more. But eventually the manager started seeing that Brad and I could update each others code easily. and that we could jump into any project either of us had done and keep going when the other was out. Lucy on the other hand could not even with her own code. Eventually we started pushing for code reviews infront of the manager and pointed out the variable naming and the spaghetti like structure of her code. And then we would ask the dreaded question. How long will it take for you to update this if the customer decides that the zip code should not be an integer and now should be alpha for overseas deliveries? How long will it take you to find the various textbox1’s on all the screens and actually know which one houses which database information fields?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nabout 2 months of that and Lucy got mad and quit our team.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPS Let me be very clear before anyone goes off on me picking on a woman.

Excellently written.  Reposting with Permission.","authors":[{"name":"rnbergren","id":7772038}],"summary":"What were some “red flags” new hires shouldn't ignore when starting a new job?<br />\r\nAll Credit to <br />\r\nDon Sevcik, President of MathCelebrity and Author of 2 books<br />\r\nUpdated Jul 4<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLet’s discuss 10 red flags to watch for within the first 3 months of your job. 3 months gives you ample time to find. My credentials for this answer: 20+ years in the corporate America cube farm. Fortune 500, mid-level, and start-ups. Ready…Let’s go get it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.Has your job, in the first few weeks, suddenly morphed into something different from the job role on your employment contract? And, if you call management out on it, and they use silly phrases like not “being flexible”. Congratulations, you’ve found your first red flag<br />\r\na.Aside: If you learn nothing else from this post, read this: “Flexible” and “Team Player” mean do more work, but not get paid for it. Learn this quickly. Because the most important thing every morning is waking up, looking in the mirror, and being able to respect yourself.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2.If you work in a job as a “doer”, such as developer, builder of things, etc., do you find yourself booked up in many meetings? Then congratulations, you’ve discovered a red flag. “Doers” should not be in too many meetings. Because gasp…they need time to actually do stuff. If management cannot squash this early so you can do what you do best, you’ve found yourself at a mismanaged company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3.In the first few weeks of joining a company, do you notice lots of “cliques” and keep running into “unexpected, unspoken rules?” If so, you’ve dug up another red flag.<br />\r\na.I remember working at a company years back, doing development. In my interview, I was crystal clear…”I don’t like filling out a lot of paperwork to push code. I just want to code, test quickly, and push it out there.” Alas, 3 weeks after getting hired, management “revealed” that every code push needs a 3 page document filled out, a web form filled out, 3 layers of approval, just to get a change in. It’s ridiculous. The more red tape, the bigger the red flag.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4.Does your company push “social-time” off hours and unnecessary get-togethers? Do they push, and I mean push charities, social justice groups, and other hootenanny garbage? Congratulations, you’ve found another red flag. Nowhere in any standard employment contract anywhere, does it state you must be active with charity, social justice causes, and any of that other garbage. Nor should it, because none of that has one iota to do with your job and the company making money. Not one iota. So if it’s pushed on you, run for the hills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n5.Does your company value “in-office” time more than they do accomplishments during your work hours? If so, you’ve found another archaic, and detrimental red-flag. If I get 8 hours of work done in 2 hours, then what I do after that shouldn’t matter. Because, it’s not like corporate will pay you more for additional effort. Great bosses will let you leave early and give flex time when you pump out work quickly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n6.Do scheduled meetings always run over time, or start late, or both? Congratulations, you’ve found another red-flag. Time wasters. Also, meetings, especially corporate meetings, are notorious for posturing and politics. And if you aren't a fan of meetings like me, then this is a HUGE red flag. Meetings should have an agenda, allow no rambling, and get to the point quick. As in, who is doing what, who needs help, and when can we expect things to get done. That’s it. No more.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n7.Are you having a hard time finding a document about annual raises and bonuses? As in, you do “x” and “y”, and this is how you advance. And when you ask about it, does your manager hem and haw or avoid the subject. Congratulations, you’ve found another red flag found at 90% or more of corporate jobs.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n8.Does the majority of people at or above your level use unnecessary buzz words to describe something? As in, can you find a word from grade 5 to grade 7 on the Flesch-Kincaid reading level to replace their silly buzzword, and not only keep the meaning of what they were trying to say, but enhance it? Congratulations, you’ve found another red flag. The key to communication is simplicity and clarity. And buzzwords violate both those rules. And if we can’t have a simple conversation about “my contract” and not “annual incentive protocol”, then we have a red flag on our hands.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n9.Do the dumbest people get promoted, and the superstars get passed over or marginalized? Congratulations young padawan, you’ve uncorked another red flag. And this, like #7, happens at 90% or more of corporate companies. It’s red flag football, and you never score a touchdown.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n10.Does your new company change “direction” every 2–4 weeks? Pat yourself on the back detective, you’ve found another red flag. If management cannot figure out what to do, and they get paid large coin to do one job, then you’ve found yourself at an insane asylum. Best to pull the cord and exit stage left.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHeed these 10 rules my friends, they just might save your life down the road.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/donsevcik\"><br />\r\n<blockquote class=\"quote\"><div class=\"op\">Quote:</div>Don's linked in Account</blockquote><br />\r\n</a>[<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/donsevcik\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>]<br />\r\n<div class=\"signature\">To err is human to really mess up you need a computer</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2019-08-30T08:59:00","modifiedDate":"2019-08-30T08:59:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2020-07-18T03:53:00","rating":5.0,"votes":9,"popularity":4.77121258,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5658159/Red-Flags-in-a-new-Job-Excellently-written-Reposti","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":5658159,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"5663284","title":"Re: Red Flags in a new Job.

In our office, established for just over a year there's me with bags of commercial IT experience, plus a guy with a PhD in aeronautical engineering, excellent dev &amp; very quick on the uptake working with C# &amp; SQL where possible.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the other office they have been established over 10 years and the IT is doing the job the company needs, but there are no good practices.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSome examples :-<br />\r\n<br />\r\nVirtually all development is in Python, which is run as a mass of scheduled tasks.  There is one particular task that runs around lunchtime to pick up all the submissions from the previous day, and another to pick up the same class of thing to mop up what has come in today runs at around 5pm.  Each is a separate python script with a couple of classes declared at the top (which are declared in virtually every script I have seen), followed by around 1000 lines of code mixing in database access, processing logic &amp; composition of output XML in a single block of code with nothing split out for readability.  The two scripts differ in four lines - they don't appear to have heard of parameters.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, they don't appear to have heard of stored procedures; I have seen scripts where, to get nested information, they run an inline query to get a set of data, then walk the set in Python &amp; fire a separate query to get related information for each row.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDid I mention that they have no form of source control?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI really need to change the culture in the other office (I do have my boss's support in this).  I started by going in there &amp; demonstrating a bit of separation of concerns using classes in Python and unit testing, then leaving a copy of Clean Code with the guy who seems to be the main trusted developer who people look to for advice, but it sat on his desk unopened for 2 weeks.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the plus side, a young guy (just 18, left school at 16, started in the warehouse &amp; moved into development purely because he showed an interest in it) emailed me to say he hoped it was OK that he had taken the book home at the weekend to read, and is picking up C# with remote assistance from me.  He's mega-keen &amp; will probably make an excellent developer.  There are other developers who also seem willing to learn, and they have all said that that the guru is very set in his ways.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, any ideas on how I can start moving them towards learning sensible IT practices as a matter of course? I feel the main obstacle is the guru chap, but he has the trust of his non-technical superiors, so technical explanations may be wasted on them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne possible light is that we will be examining the code of a product developed by a third party, written in VS Code C# - I'm hoping it will open their eyes to the possibilities, though I'm not looking forward to explaining &lt;t&gt; notation to Python devs, should it arise.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nRegards &amp; TIA","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2019-06-27T16:42:00","modifiedDate":"2019-06-27T16:42:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2019-08-02T03:20:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5639666/Culture-Change-Advice-Sought","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":5639666,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"5640034","title":"Re: Culture Change - Advice Sought","authors":[{"name":"Daniel Pfeffer","id":687871}],"summary":"First, the bad news.

Since all current projects are moving to BIG DATA , started learning BIG Data (Hadoop exactly ) and identified that it requires either Java or Python programming knowledge and i feel like am not up to it or either data analytics statistics etc.,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nwhile researching observed that SAP HANA also has interesting insights to it.Since, i dont want to go programming side , please let me know how good it is to consider HANA as next career path and will these open sources will SAP related technologies survive and will be in demand?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf any other technologies considering DWH , DB background that can be considered, pls share.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks in advance.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2019-05-29T06:58:00","modifiedDate":"2019-05-29T06:58:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2021-08-21T00:58:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5632121/Career-Dilemma-BIG-DATA-Vs-SAP-HANA-Pls-help","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":5632121,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"5827746","title":"Re: Career Dilemma - BIG DATA Vs SAP HANA-Pls help","authors":[{"name":"Mark Thurlo 2021","id":15331227}],"summary":"Just become a manager.

I know my question will receive some opinionated responses but not necessarily and regardless, it is something I really would like to ask people who are already working in the field.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI got into a developer's position a few years ago and it has been quite stressful for me. I feel I'm an intelligent person, I like technology, video games, programming etc. I have a passion for programming although sometimes I find it fading but I try to remain optimistic.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen I was interviewed for this position I made no effort to oversell myself. I was very upfront and honest about what I knew and didn't know. I provided code examples of what I had worked on and took a test that was assigned to me all before being hired. The position was supposed to be more of an entry level position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt first I was really excited. So happy to finally be a developer. I wanted to learn as much as I could. I didn't necessarily want to stay with the company but I was happy to have got the position and wanted to learn all I could while I was here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nProblems soon arose and it's from these problems that I'm trying to get some insight into the industry to see what the job life is like for programmers outside of my little world/company.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe company I work for is a fortune 500 company, they are huge, all over the place, international, they're everywhere and you know them I promise, I prefer not to say though for privacy reasons. That being said, I was happy to get into this \"entry level\" programming position in this huge company cause I knew it would be a great learning experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI soon found out that I was being relied upon quite heavily and with very little guidance. My position, although I'm required to be in an office location, is virtual. Meaning, every programmer is at a different location, including my supervisors and management, and some (especially management) work from home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of my pet peeves is that, although I have a company laptop, and there's little to no collaboration taking place, I can't work from home myself, I have to carry my laptop with me and plug it in at the office I work at. While this irritates me alot, I can totally cope with this if the rest were ok.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy biggest gripe is the lack of collaboration, guidance, communication, and give a *@!$. I am given projects, with little to no background information, most the time via email, and that is it. I am told to ask questions if I have any. The majority of the time, my entire time spent here is one big question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm trying to figure out, is this how it is where everyone works? Is it normal to hire entry level programmers, provide them with little to no guidance/training, and just assign them tasks to see if they'll still have their hair by the time it's all said and done?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis is something I'm really honestly curious about. I've been doing this for about 3 years now. I've learned things and manage to complete all of my projects on time but it's the process and the way things are managed that drive me nuts. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are also long periods of time where I won't be assigned anything. I'm virtual so I come into an office that has nothing to do with me and sit. Sitting and waiting has been a large majority of my duties. My work life is a bit of a roller coaster. There's a very slow incline and then I'll get a project with no information or guidance and then it's a steep drop till I reach the end...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHalf the time I feel it's just me, the rest I feel that it's just this place. That is why I'm on here to get an idea of what a programmer's daily job life is like.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you often find yourself with no resources or feel like you're kind of just there lol... I laugh but this has been the strangest and not so funny situation I have ever been in.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also find patterns among people, ways of thinking among management. Things seem to be severely lacking. My idea is that the grass is greener on the other side but I'd like to hear from you all to see if that truly is the case or if I just need to suck it up and enjoy it somehow.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo give you an example, I was given a C# project recently, as I have many times in the past. I'm fine programming and figuring stuff out, I enjoy it, but there are times you just want to ask someone a question.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe person that was working on this C# project is no longer with us and I just found out I'm pretty much the only one that has any experience at all with C#... So me, an entry level programmer that had hoped this position would be a great learning experience is now more of a dreaded daily nightmare... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do my best to accept and deal with the situations at hand and try not to panic but it can be hard at times. My thing is, why does it have to be like this and is it like this everywhere?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm not a dumb person, all I need half the time are some simple questions answered but I can't rely at all on the group I work for and it seems like they simply expect me to be Albert Einstein or something.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThen there's the guilt I feel for not knowing or feeling like I can't complete a task that gets assigned to me and fear of failure... It's just ridiculous.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust to elaborate on the sitting and waiting. There are times I'll be assigned something, complete it, and I don't hear from anyone about anything for days or weeks. This feels like a giant waste of my time and I know it is.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSometimes I won't be assigned anything at all so I'll email my supervisor and just say \"Hey if I can help with anything let me know\" and I may or may not hear back for who knows how long. I kind of stopped doing this though because now, I kind of enjoy not having anything to work on cause it tends to be stressful when I do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMy next steps are dealing with this a bit longer and spending my free time doing some coding of my own, brushing up my skills, and finding a new job. This is another reason why I ask this question because I want to hear what I may be getting myself into.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you've read all of this thank you and if you have anything to share please do.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-06-21T17:02:00","modifiedDate":"2018-06-21T17:02:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2018-08-12T12:56:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5531024/What-is-the-business-world-like-for-a-programmer","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":5531024,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"5536231","title":"Re: What is the business world like for a programmer?","authors":[{"name":"Nitin S","id":4187012}],"summary":"<img src=\"https://www.codeproject.com/script/Forums/Images/smiley_confused.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Confused | :confused:\" /> <br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\">=====================================================<br />\r\nThe grass is always greener on the other side of the fence</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-07-11T06:25:00","modifiedDate":"2018-07-11T06:25:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2018-08-12T12:56:00","rating":1.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5536231/Re-What-is-the-business-world-like-for-a-programme","apiLink":"","parentId":5531024,"threadId":5531024,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"5540654","title":"Re: What is the business world like for a programmer?","authors":[{"name":"Nathan Minier","id":10813630}],"summary":"First of all, I know it's a bit late, but welcome to the community. Know that your experience is not unique, is not even rare, but is generally par for the course. There are very serious pluses and minuses to being a dev, but let's talk about something else first: soft skills.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBy and large developers tend to regard logic, efficiency, and technical ability as positive traits. This is not the case with people in the lion's share of other disciplines, and over time this leads to many devs being a bit more reclusive and less invested in the work of others; to the point where the caginess of programmers is pretty much a stereotype. Now, this caginess is not reserved for \"outsiders\", but rather anyone that does not meet each individual's bar for competence. This is the first primary contributing factor in the response that you've received, and don't be so self-centered as to assume that how people interact with you has everything (or anything) to do with you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow to where my own caginess might show: the things that you're complaining about are actually the job. Yeah, writing code is nice and all, but it's not the hard part of the job. Expressing yourself in code is a baseline, and every knowledge domain is different, so each new project will, largely, throw you right back into a pit of not knowing what's going on, not having a foundation in the subject matter, or generally not being sure of where to immediately go. This is entirely the reason we have an SDLC and why the things that may not have seemed terribly important in school are very important in practice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou're also not expected to know everything, despite how it might feel at the moment, but you are expected to be able to figure things out that are in the knowledge domain of the company that you work for. You are expected to understand some patterns and practices when it comes specifically to engineering, but that's part of the trade. Never, ever, play \"smart\" when you're lost: questions are invaluable, ask them! <br />\r\n<br />\r\nLearn to provide realistic estimates (the Scotty rule can help...) so that you don't always feel under the gun. Sharpen your research skills; Google is the ultimate expression of RTFM, and being able to read up on APIs or even check source on GitHub is a gigantic leg up. Utilize it without shame or fear.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhen you don't have a current project, experiment. Play with a language or technology. Look for holes that you can plug. Make a space for yourself within the organization.<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\">\"Never attribute to malice that which can be explained by stupidity.\"<br />\r\n- Hanlon's Razor</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-07-26T08:39:00","modifiedDate":"2018-07-26T08:39:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2018-08-12T12:56:00","rating":5.0,"votes":9,"popularity":4.77121258,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5540654/Re-What-is-the-business-world-like-for-a-programme","apiLink":"","parentId":5531024,"threadId":5531024,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"5545399","title":"Re: What is the business world like for a programmer?","authors":[{"name":"kmoorevs","id":3347653}],"summary":"It's a shame that a great answer like this that obviously took some time and effort has not been recognized an upvoted.

For actual message encryption, your PUBLIC ENCRYPT key will be used to encrypt it so that only your PRIVATE DECRYPT key can decrypt it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWith the PKI model, you can freely hand out your public keys (or they are stored in a central repository, such as on a domain) while your private keys needs to be properly secured to prevent compromise.<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\">\"There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics.\"<br />\r\n- Benjamin Disraeli</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-05-10T11:58:00","modifiedDate":"2018-05-10T11:58:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2021-07-14T03:46:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5518655/Re-Private-Public-Key-Pair-Im-unsure-please-help-t","apiLink":"","parentId":5518646,"threadId":5518646,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"5518657","title":"Re: Private/Public Key Pair, I'm unsure, please help to clarify","authors":[{"name":"User 11060979","id":11095207}],"summary":"Thank you very much <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/thumbs_up.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Thumbs Up | :thumbsup:\" /> <br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\"><small>It does not solve my Problem, but it answers my question</small></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-05-10T12:04:00","modifiedDate":"2021-01-19T21:04:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2021-07-14T03:46:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5518657/Re-Private-Public-Key-Pair-Im-unsure-please-help-t","apiLink":"","parentId":5518655,"threadId":5518646,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"5820663","title":"Re: Private/Public Key Pair, I'm unsure, please help to clarify","authors":[{"name":"User 14076552","id":14109043}],"summary":"Hi !<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe logical to remember with Public , Private Keys is about 2 crypting channels.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom both sides, 2 differents Keys will operate.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike all cryptos, one can be reverse , not the other.<br />\r\nBut the A to B, B to A must transmit all datas, and verify them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLook at what can be switch : ( What is surrounding ? )<br />\r\nComputer A , Computer B<br />\r\nKeys A , Key B<br />\r\nPrivate function crypto<br />\r\nPublic function crypto<br />\r\nClock from A(all in) , Clock from B(all in)<br />\r\nchecksum A , checksum B<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nwhile you ensure no errors of receiver .<br />\r\nThe work is all done.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's \"pair\" working.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2021-07-14T03:46:00","modifiedDate":"2021-08-23T21:01:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2021-07-14T03:46:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5820663/Re-Private-Public-Key-Pair-Im-unsure-please-help-t","apiLink":"","parentId":5518657,"threadId":5518646,"indentLevel":3},{"id":"5476561","title":"I can't get email confirmation mail.","authors":[{"name":"Heath Kim","id":5297255}],"summary":"I changed my email and didn't get a confirmation mail from codeproject.<br />\r\nRetried several times but no luck.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI can't change it back to previous mail also.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlease help.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2018-01-16T00:03:00","modifiedDate":"2018-02-11T10:35:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2018-01-16T03:48:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/5476561/I-cant-get-email-confirmation-mail","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":5476561,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"5465015","title":"Getting negative votes from author without mentioning proper reason","authors":[{"name":"Biswal Tanmaya","id":11155279}],"summary":"I got -50 points around for this article <a href=\"https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1220377/Improve-the-Way-of-Writing-Functions\">Improve-the-Way-of-Writing-Functions </a>.

To that end, I think you are partially correct, but I think we differ in three key respects, unless I misunderstood you.<br />\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><b>Every</b> function or method should be prefaced with a short explanation of the algorithm that it implements or the task that it performs. Obviously, if the function is part of the public interface, this comment should take the form of an XML comment, which need not be repeated as a regular comment. You can also make a good case for attaching XML comments to <i>every</i> method. Indeed, I usually follow this practice in my own work, and I've seen it often in the work of others.</li><li><b>Every</b> class must begin with a short explanatory comment about its purpose. As is the case with methods, this can take the form of XML commenting.</li><li><b>Every</b> module must contain a change log, and you must be fastidious about adding a note, brief though it may be, <b>every</b> time you change it.</li></ul>\r\nWith respect to the third point, some would argue that this is the purpose of check-in comments, but my experience has been that these are almost invariably insufficient to properly document what changed, and why a file was included in a given changeset. I have wasted many valuable hours, usually aided by side by side changeset comparisons, to obtain such knowledge, which would be ridiculously easy to put into a change log. In my view, the changeset log is just not sufficiently granular to be your whole change history.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, in the first point, I mentioned attaching XML comments to all methods. The benefits of doing so are twofold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1 Since IntelliSense picks up local XML comments, it's easier to consume provate methods in other parts of the same project.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2 If you decide later to make a class or method public, the XML comments are already there, so the only required change is to the access modifier.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile I agree with you that commenting can be used to compensate for sloppy code, there are some things that just cannot be documented by the code alone.<br />\r\n\r\n<div class=\"signature\">David A.

Perfectly acceptable. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, I don't agree with putting even XML comments everywhere even when the code is self-evident. If I as a developer don't write clean enough code that reveals its intentions and purposes then how can I be relied upon to write clear concise comments? At best/worst I might be lying about the code which probably will become clear in code reviews but code reviews are about the code, not comments. Code executes, comments don't. If I am going to spend effort anyway, I'd rather use it to refactor code, not comments. Not to mention maintaining code itself is a major task add to that the burden of maintaining the comments and the whole thing becomes a real drag on programmer productivity. I much rather spend that time on refactoring and testing the code to make it as clear and provable as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlus, compiler provides little to no support for comments (apart from cosmetic colour coding) and any time I change a method signature or the purpose, comments don't auto update because they can't read my mind! Now, office politics perhaps may be a reason why someone might get forced to write comments despite their better judgement, which I think might be at play in my case.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn the change log, I believe check-in comments are the place to put your reasoning to have changed any code. This way I can look at the comments in source control and if I feel like I can just do a diff to see what changed and whether or not it correlates to the comment. Ultimately, its about the developer discipline and I much rather use it to write meaningful and clean code, test cases and check-in comments rather than bunging everything in the source code file that contains everything but meaningful code. Its like my grandma used to say, \"Everything in its place and a place for everything!\". <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for your input anyway.

Instead, programmers were urged to enter dated comments adjacent to code changes. While this is nice, and I do that, you can't find them without searching the file for a date, and praying that everyone writes theirs in the same format.

Its a maintenance nightmare by their own admission, so it hasn't \"clearly worked\" but \"somehow worked\" for them. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe team working on this rewrite is only 3-4 people (for now) me, another senior dev, a product manager and a lead dev  who's the only person who's worked on the old product and knows a lot more of it, rest of us all are new hires. During my interview with the lead dev and the director it was made amply clear that they lack experience in Azure, Scrum, TDD and they are looking for someone with <b>new ideas</b> and who can \"<b>rock the boat</b>\". Having worked on rewrites before in similar environments where I wasn't just a developer who got handed down specs but was actively contributing to the architecture and design of the product (i.e. <b>senior dev</b>), I fit the bill. We discussed at length about various architecture and design options available to realise the product vision during the interview and again during my casual visits to their offices until I formally joined. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I would say, the team was fairly aware of my mandate, but I guess they are not budging on the comments issue so my best strategy is write clean code and comment only where I must and then butt heads if that becomes an issue. Moving on is always an option if there is no clear resolution because I am not going to just accept it simply because the lead dev says so.

The latter you probably need to do anyway, at least for public APIs. Besides that, imho some visual indicator on top of each function / class etc makes it easier to navigate through code. So a short block on top of each function can act as kind of a separator (like headlines in normal texts), that allows to quickly see where a function starts. So (meanwhile) I add at least a single line with dashes on top of each function, and find that quite useful.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for comments, I agree with those people, who say code should be written in a way that comments are not necessary. Means: Use names that say what it is about rather than comments, split complicated constructs into multiple steps, even if it appears less \"cool\" (functional programming!) etc.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, there are cases, where comments are a good idea. Not just to explain some parts of the code that are hard to understand, but also to indicate that something <i>might</i> look like a bug or a wired construct, but is actually intended.

Fixing them is easier.<br />\r\nMost often, people flock to the well known and used answer of “My biggest weakness is that I am a perfectionist”.<br />\r\nThere are a few reasons why this answer doesn’t bode well for many interviewees. One reason is that it is completely overused and unoriginal. Another is that it is an answer that is designed to try to make you look good and the person interviewing you can see right through this!<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>How can you answer this:</b><br />\r\nThere is no definite way of answering this question. Just make sure that your answer is honest, shows self- introspection and includes a story of self improvement.

I have been a big supporter of Microsoft for years but lately all they produce is garbage.  I understand the basic Ideology of MVVM for applications but WPF is terrible at delivering this.  It used to be a simple task to wire up a simple combo box to display a list of options but with WPF its not so simple.  In fact when I started to ask questions about how to do it the only response I get was \"ummm.... I have to look at your code\"  no one seems to have a simple response.  Even researching online I never see a clear example not even from Microsoft's own site.  So if the company that wrote this can't provide a simple example why are so many people dedicated to make this sh*t work.  The entire platform is not obvious and the learning curve is too steep.  Additionally, it seems that performance of these applications is terrible and buggy.  Yet you see the demand for everyone to have this skill set from employers.  A framework should deliver the following features to developers: stability of execution, obviousness of design, simplicity, and hopefully a reduction of effort.  If you can't ensure these traits don't deliver a product, you will just weaken the end user.  I don't feel that WPF delivers any of these traits.  In fact a much broader statement could be made here Microsoft as a company no longer supplies this, or maybe it never did.  I started looking back at everything Microsoft has produced and I realized its just a lousy provider of software in general.  I kind of wish more people would abandon these products for the sake of pressuring these industry giants to start providing better solutions.  If we as a community continue to accept inferior tools to do our jobs it will only become more difficult to progress forward.  I know that some people will say \"well if you don't like Microsoft what would you use in place of it?\"  The answer is I don't have a good answer to that one.  There are so many lousy software companies out there that provide bottom of the barrel products that there is no safe haven for anyone.  I see too many times that people generate so many patches or hack code to work around platform bugs that I wonder what would the software look like if you didn't always have to fix the code before you work on your own problem.

This made me develop an ever growing passion for scripting and developing. In my spare time I began building scripts in Ruby and even dipped my toe in Visual C#. Slowly but surely the passion became obsession and now I find myself unfulfilled by my current career direction.

I like the idea of taking a full program in a respectable institution for the idea that it will really fill in my weaknesses and give me the best odds for finding long term employment but I don't know if I am aggrandizing these types of institutions and the weight they carry. I want to find something that will give me the best bang for my buck in terms of time spent vs employment opportunities. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasically just looking for some anecdotal thoughts and options on these two tracks and what program(s) would you pursue if you were starting out as a beginner all over again.

In the training you can discuss the algorithm. <br />\r\n  In fact you can hold one more session to discuss the coding part of it(Filter out the people whose idea is innovative).<br />\r\n   - This way, may be some of them can even come up with a patent of their own.<br />\r\n   - Development includes innovation as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  2) Or, an interactive session could be some thing like giving them a complex piece of code in   the training and telling them to give their thoughts on it. <br />\r\n   - Thoughts could be code optimization<br />\r\n   - Impending/Current bugs in the code<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  3) A reverse of the point 2 could be fruitful as well, i.e. telling them to find out a code full of bugs.<br />\r\n   - You can have a \"lessons learned\" session to not write such a code (Which we very frequently have  <img src=\"https://codeproject.freetls.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" />  ).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n  I would also suggest to not give this task in pairs in the beginning, this would help every one to speed up as soon as possible.<br />\r\n  <br />\r\n It could also happen that the first session might not fruitful, but consecutive sessions will work fine.

Here's a summary of where I am in life: I just finished a Computer Science degree at a small college in my small hometown. My parents were very unsuccessful in life, and can't offer me real-world advice besides \"Get any job you can!\" I managed to graduate without retaining much information, and I completely failed to prepare for my life ahead. Now that I'm out of school, I can clearly see how unprepared I am for working with people in a corporate environment. I'm also very reluctant to move somewhere else to find work because 1) I basically already own my own small dream home in a decent neighborhood, and 2) my mother is getting old and won't be able to support herself much longer. She doesn't have any retirement savings, and I'm the only one left in her life to support her.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, now I'm trying to grow up real fast and make some responsible decisions. I feel like my only hope is to find a way to make money remotely online. I would love to do freelance work, but I can't afford to travel to meet with clients, and I'm afraid I won't understand the projects I'm lucky enough to get.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlternatively, I'm considering developing my own software/apps and marketing them myself. I'm creative enough to design novel and useful software, and I'm not afraid to handle the marketing and business aspects, but I don't know what \"running a business\" really involves.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI want to make it clear that I'm not looking for an easy way out. And I don't need to make loads of money to maintain my lifestyle. We've been supporting ourselves on minimum wage income for years. I'm just looking for a feasible plan to support a modest life without risking poverty.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would welcome any realistic ideas/perspectives about my situation, or a better website to post my questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThank you for anything you can offer.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2014-07-15T16:23:00","modifiedDate":"2014-07-15T16:23:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2014-09-09T06:28:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4861846/Looking-for-urgent-career-freelance-advice","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":4861846,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"4895200","title":"Re: Looking for urgent career/freelance advice","authors":[{"name":"Ganesh KP","id":8282489}],"summary":"Hi Conway,<br />\r\n<br />\r\nafter reading your story, I understood that you need a job near by your home town or else you want to do a freelancing job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, let me explain you one thing here as you said, you are just a graduate passed out.

But people who works need to travel from one place to another place.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe scenario works for an experienced freelancer as they will have a lot of projects in hand and they can work from home (in their own decent home).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut as you are a fresher and I think you opinion on living in your village and asking that you wanted to do or wanted to achieve seems to be not a right track that your are in actually.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere are many freelancing sites available in internet.

It's never easy making the move from managing yourself to managing others.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere's no magic formula to being a good manager but a couple of things that will help are:<br />\r\nBe honest with people and don't bottle things up (that's when it becomes personal rather than business)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf someone isn't pulling their weight take them aside and let them know it.  Then work with them to resolve any blockers to their progress and between the two of you come up with a plan to get back on track.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake everyone aware of their responsibilities.  Although you need to manage them, they are responsible for their own work and they should feed back to you exactly how it's going (a potted version of this is usually enough to cover your progress report to management).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have people on the team who are under-utilised, make use of them.  Give them a little more responsibility, something like putting together progress reports or doing some resource planning.  They will usually appreciate you having faith in their abilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlthough you can still have a bit of fun with the team (and sometimes humour does help) it's important to remember that you still need to be impartial so don't get dragged into petty squabbles.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt's also handy if you can get yourself some kind of coach to help you work through the tougher times and help maintain your sanity (I found a coach to be so helpful, I started doing it myself).  Coaching is also an easy thing to pick up the basics of, and can be used with your team.  It gets away from the bitching and whining and works on the issue.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf time is short, invest in one of the  DK Essential Manager Manuals.  This gives a potted summary of all aspects of management and can get you off to a quick start.  Although it's quite a thick book, it doesn't go into too much detail and you can dip in and out of it. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope this helps and things start going smoother. <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2013-10-10T16:05:00","modifiedDate":"2013-10-10T16:05:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2013-10-10T16:05:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4677846/Re-Looking-for-advice","apiLink":"","parentId":4626309,"threadId":4626128,"indentLevel":3},{"id":"4621934","title":"ASP.NET MVC","authors":[{"name":"Simon_Whale","id":6620781}],"summary":"Does anyone know of a good course provider in the UK for intermediate level MVC? preferably around the Oxford area<br />\r\n<div class=\"signature\">Every day, thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp end the violence <b>EAT BACON</b></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2013-07-26T11:14:00","modifiedDate":"2013-07-26T11:14:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2013-11-14T10:47:00","rating":1.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4621934/ASP-NET-MVC","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":4621934,"indentLevel":0}]},{"pagination":{"page":15,"pageSize":25,"totalPages":103,"totalItems":2555},"items":[{"id":"4702083","title":"Re: ASP.NET MVC","authors":[{"name":"super","id":36831}],"summary":"Looking for a inhouse instructor led training or webinar/online will suffice?<br />\r\n<div class=\"signature\">cheers,<br />\r\nSuper<br />\r\n------------------------------------------<br />\r\nToo much of good is bad,mix some evil in it<br />\r\n</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2013-11-14T08:54:00","modifiedDate":"2013-11-14T08:54:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2013-11-14T10:47:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4702083/Re-ASP-NET-MVC","apiLink":"","parentId":4621934,"threadId":4621934,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"4702092","title":"Re: ASP.NET MVC","authors":[{"name":"Simon_Whale","id":6620781}],"summary":"it took a while but we found an company that specialises in, in house training<br />\r\n<div class=\"signature\">Every day, thousands of innocent plants are killed by vegetarians.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHelp end the violence <b>EAT BACON</b></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2013-11-14T09:01:00","modifiedDate":"2013-11-14T09:01:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2013-11-14T10:47:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/4702092/Re-ASP-NET-MVC","apiLink":"","parentId":4702083,"threadId":4621934,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"4702229","title":"Re: ASP.NET MVC","authors":[{"name":"NickPace","id":4405680}],"summary":"It is not instructor lead, but I just went through a free PluralSight course on ASP.NET MVC 4.

I also like embedded programming so I'll give you some links to useful info but you'll have to decide what you're interested in and where to invest your time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLike the other people said predictions are hard to make especially about the future. Although I don't agree with some of the more extreme cloud computing people I would say that things are probably going to continue to get more webified. Even things like the user interface for operating systems are starting to use web languages. And as long as hardware keeps getting cheaper (although moore's law is showing some signs of slowing down) I don't see any end to the prolifieration of high level stuff (frameworks, libraries, high level languages, and off the shelf solutions) at the expense of program efficiency. In the embedded world this will probably mean that assembly programming will probably continue to decline in importance although effiency will still matter some because battery life is somewhat correlated to program efficiency.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you want to get into the embedded field the big languages seem to be C or C++ with assembly and Ada sometimes used too. Another thing to keep in mind is that some hardware knowledge is useful if you do any of the lower level programming. In fact many embedded programmers have Electrical Engineering or Computer Engineering backgrounds instead of Computer Science backgrounds. There's also something called FPGA programming but you really have to understand  electrical engineering for that. They use special languages for that.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor learning linux I would recommend learning the command line if you haven't already. Even though it seems obsolete to me compared to IDEs some places still use it for linux programming. In fact I used it on my last job. Python is also a good scripting language to know for linux people that seems to have been gaining popularity for a long time with no end in sight.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<blockquote class=\"FQ\"><div class=\"FQA\">Pathachiever wrote:</div> I never worked with Embedded programming because the starter kit's were too expensive. <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_frown.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Frown | :(\" /> </blockquote><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI bought 2 different ones that were $40 a piece although this was several years ago. One was Microchip which unfortunately didn't include a C compiler, only an assembler and another one from Zilog that did have a C compiler. Try looking at digikey.com and if you aren't sure which to buy call them and ask for a tech person and tell them your situation and budget and that you want one with a c or c++ compiler included and they're usually pretty helpful and actually know what they're talking about.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso if you're interested in real time operating systems this is good freertos.org since you can get and look at the source code. If you want to really understand it you're going to have to buy the ebook that explains it. But I've read it and it's a pretty good book that not only explains freertos but real time concepts in general. But you'll need to understand general operating system concepts first like deadlocks, mutexes, semaphores ect.. first or it might not make sense.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso if your interested in embedded stuff this language Ada might interest you. It's not real popular but it's used in some really important stuff like airplane controls, nuclear power plants, spacecraft, ect... beacause the language was build with strong error checking in mind.

My main job is software development and customer support for tiny software company. (One programmer, me) As a developer, and taking every opportunity to automate processes, my first thought was that we should be able to get an export for our customers that are setup for automatic billing from the system we are leaving, and import this information into the new system. These customers have, at some sime or another, provided us with signed authorization forms with full card information. Policy is that once the card numbers have been entered into the online system, all but the last 4 card numbers are blacked out. My problem is that the only export I can get from the old system has the card numbers obfuscated, only showing the last four, and no expiration date is available. When I mentioned this to the facilities supervisor, she said that we are not planning to try to import. She has new authorization forms for the recurring customers which will give us their card numbers again. To me, this is a complete waste of time and resources. Between all the facilities, I would estimate that we have between 300 and 400 customers that will be affected. A change in our payment system should not affect our customers, or cause them any undue inconvenience. I am sure that someone out there has experience with moving customer credit card records from one system to another. First, I just want to make sure that the company we are leaving will allow us to retrieve full card numbers and expiration dates for our customers.

They are after all not really 'certified' as a valid educational pathway in most areas like an official degree is, but even those you need to watch out for. Make sure you use an accredited school and not one of those graduate mills that you see advertise on TV.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, JUST Getting a degree may not be a great option either. As many people find out, a degree is no substitute for experience, and there is lies the catch-22. You usually cannot get experience without a degree, and getting a degree without experience shows that you can read and pass a test but... well you get it from here.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPersonally, I went the way of bruit force... Self employed. I started my own consulting business, ran classes on my own, did jobs that I knew I could do and studied like heck to do the rest. Interestingly enough even without having a degree of any kind until recently (just so I could teach in fact) I had found myself gainfully employed for a 10 year period of time at Intel and a few other companies that typically do not take non degreed people at all. Lucky? Maybe.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI DO HIGHLY recommend that you build your portfolio that hot only highlights every educational opportunity that you take but also highlights WORK that you have done. Just like artists carry them around, so should IT people. Examples of systems designed, problems solved, code written, papers published, etc... I also highly recommend that you keep a history (with proof) of any and all training classes and industry events that you take/attend here just to show that you are a non-stop learner. Remember, just because you get a degree does not mean you can at any time say 'I am done, know what I need and now its time to just work'... BS... Learning is a constant process that never stops. You should show that you understand and live by that constantly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour portfolio should show that.<br />\r\n<div class=\"signature\"><hr><a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/raycassick\">LinkedIn</a>[<a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/raycassick\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>] | <a href=\"http://blogs.enterprocity.com/blogs/\">Blog</a>[<a href=\"http://blogs.enterprocity.com/blogs/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>] | <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rcassick\">Twitter</a>[<a href=\"http://twitter.com/rcassick\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>]</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2011-01-09T10:19:00","modifiedDate":"2011-01-09T10:19:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2011-01-19T12:50:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/3726665/Re-question-regarding-certification-vs-degree-rele","apiLink":"","parentId":3722263,"threadId":3722263,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"3740217","title":"Re: question regarding certification vs. degree relevance","authors":[{"name":"Steve Maier","id":2820}],"summary":"Adding to what both of the other replies have....<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI do have alot of certifications.  I started looking at them after I had a MS but wanted to continue my learning.  A pHd was not really an option for me, so certifications were the direction I went it.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertifications will NOT get you a job.  I have talked to many people about this.  As others have pointed out, certifications show that you can take exams and that you know how Microsoft wants the answers.  For example, on database questions with a cross reference table, many/most DBA types will just put in the indexes of the other tables.  Microsoft expects you to have a separate index for the cross reference.  Neither is \"wrong\" but you need to know how to answer to pass the exams.  Other people point to the \"paper MCSE\" that exist.  These are people that have never managed a server or network but took all the exams to give them the cert.  Children at the age of 10 have gotten this cert.  This really makes people uncertain if you are just good at taking tests, if you cheated, or if you really know your stuff.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCould certifications move your resume to the short pile when job hunting?  yes.  Some people like the fact that you are working on this stuff and learning it on your own or with your company and are willing to keep you around for a formal interview.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCould certifications get a promotion?  yes.  I know that my certifications have helped me to get promotions in the past.  I am constantly learning new things and using them in my day-to-day responsibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOverally, you need to practice the topics that you are going to test on.  You need to know how to really do the things they are asking about, such as localization, security, etc.  Not everyone knows those topics that well.  As it was suggested, build up a portfolio of things.  It could be articles on CP, a website for your softball team, or some little software project that you have a passion about.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne of the things told to me while I was going for my BS.  There are some things that you are going to learn that you will be using every day and those things you will memorize.  The school will then show you how to find out or research the rest of the information needed.  Knowing how to look things up and how to complete things is something that a formal education shows you.  And it shows potential employers as well.  Some people will say that even a BS is out-dated in the age of the internet and that people can do just fine without it.  But without something, projects that you have done, a degree, certifications, then there is no way for me to determine if you are the kind of person who will stick around or just decide the work is too hard and will leave.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI vote for a portfolio with certifications on the side.  The certifications will help you to look at other parts of the topics and do more than just what a project will do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDisclaimer:  I have taught college before as well as was used by the Microsoft learning group as a subject matter expert.

However, switching jobs is not. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is a simple explanation for that. When you switch jobs, you will never get to price yourself higher in your next applications. Its because employers are interested in how long you have worked in a specific position. So, lets say, for example, you have been working as a mathematician for 1 year, and then after 1 year, you switched to doing Botany. And then after that, you switched to Software Development and spent 1 year working on that field. You spent a total of 3 years working but only one year in software development. After that, you decided to apply for a different employer but same job(SW development). Most employers/companies will price you for 1 year because you are only exposed to software dev for 1 year. Do you get it now? Moral of the story? Concentrate on your field. Its good to be called \"Jack of all trades\" but its terrible if you land to become \"Master of none\".<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJust a friendly advice.  <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2011-03-28T06:51:00","modifiedDate":"2011-03-28T06:51:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2011-03-28T06:51:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/3831814/Re-Job-switching-in-software-development","apiLink":"","parentId":3461180,"threadId":3461180,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"3426570","title":"getting code related to \"routing using fuzzy systems\"","authors":[{"name":"rodamoon","id":7080711}],"summary":"Hi all,<br />\r\nI'm working on Master degree.

Things like \"Architecture’s design allows us easily and fast move Windows version under Mac OS X platform \" do not actually make sense.  People can get the idea, but you want to be clear.  I personally use past tense instead of \"AutoCad plug-in implementing.\" you could say \"Implemented an AutoCad plug-in\".  The resume/CV is about what you did.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI would put down the state that Edmond is in because nobody knows where it is with just the city name.  People know places like New York City, Boston, Chicago, etc , but I would still put the state in there as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDo you have any hard numbers on something.  For example, \"Improved the calculations system saving the company $13M each year\"  I know that is abit far fetched for most people, but hard numbers like that can help as well.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI also try to stay away from saying \"us\" or \"me\" in the resume/CV.  I do not think that it looks very professional in most cases.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHope this helps. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\">Steve Maier<br />\r\n</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2009-04-21T14:04:00","modifiedDate":"2009-04-21T14:04:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2009-04-21T14:04:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/3012272/Re-Hi-Could-anybody-check-my-CV-Critic-you-are-wel","apiLink":"","parentId":2982083,"threadId":2982083,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"2948573","title":"Providing the Cisco Certification","authors":[{"name":"MarkSeteve","id":5994196}],"summary":"Cisco Certification is a great certification for those who are seeking recognition and value in IT sector.

This is evident in the large number of employers seeking and demanding Cisco Certified professionals while making recruitments. <br />\r\nCisco has also been a pioneer in offering the Internet based services in providing customer support for selling the products, training of sales and service personnel and managing the finances. It provides three levels of certification that are Expert, Professional and Associate. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe Cisco certification begins with the Associate, which is apprentice or foundation level of networking, Professional, which is the advanced level of certification and finally Expert, which is the highest level of achievement for network professionals.

Yeah, ok, I don't get to write any cutting edge AI, or graphics, but it's still fun. I play with AI ideas in my spare time at home.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you a really dead set on finding something cutting edge, maybe consider doing masters/phd courses.

First to Java.

I didn't have any problems with understanding that a method that I wanted to call is in a separate class or even a separate DLL.  <br />\r\n2) Things that are different enough that it will take sometime to get everyone on the same page:<br />\r\n  a) Inheritance/Polymorphism - It's possible to get some of this functionality in Foxpro, so the difficulty of this one depends on the crew you work with.  But things that I've seen some get hung on are Encapsulation, Interfaces. Good class design many get hung up on.  But I've examples of those new to dotnet adding methods that manipulate the customer class to the order class, etc.<br />\r\n  b) Data Handling - There's a big, big difference between data handling in .net and Foxpro.  There are people still clinging to VFP because they think that's the only tool that handles data correctly.  Good luck on this one.<br />\r\n  c) Collections - VFP only has arrays.  I find that you use collections a whole lot more then I ever used arrays in Foxpro.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomething that I found very useful would be a fairly simple app, but enough complexity to give you enough to cover in 3 days.

However, I am generally held responsible for when things fail, even if I have specifically forewarned him of an issue that needed attention.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIs this typical of small businesses?  How do you deal with bosses (or clients) who want  to either micro-manage every aspect of what you do, even when they don't understand it, or ask you for results while vetoing your proposals?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs an example, I have to develop our internal software.  It is a poorly designed mess of Access and VBA code, both from a business and programmer perspective.  Whenever I am requested to make a change, I am never presented with the goal or problem.  I am never given requirements for changes.  Instead I am told what changes to implement, on the order of \"add three new buttons, one green, one red, one blue!\".

Often, what they suggest isn't even a viable solution.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow can I get them onto a more reasonable development model, where they present me with requirements or the business problem they are looking to solve, and I come up with the best solution, that works with our data?  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne the one hand, I feel like I am paid to do what they ask me to do, but on the other hand, I feel like, as their DBA, I am also responsible for the data, and as their developer, responsible that their software function properly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI doubt it's an issue of trust -- I have keys and full physical access to the property 24/7.  They also understand that I have full access to and control of their data, even confidential data, and why I need it.  They trust that I don't snoop through private records, even though I have the ability to.

The software is the easy part, but the communication, now that's something they don't teach you!  <img src=\"https://www.codeproject.com/script/Forums/Images/smiley_WTF.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"WTF | :WTF:\" /> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n-Joshua","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2008-08-15T15:48:00","modifiedDate":"2008-08-15T15:48:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2015-10-19T06:19:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2680605/Re-Advice-Working-for-a-Small-Business","apiLink":"","parentId":2680500,"threadId":2677582,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"2680624","title":"Re: Advice: Working for a Small Business","authors":[{"name":"Pete O'Hanlon","id":213147}],"summary":"<blockquote class=\"FQ\"><div class=\"FQA\">Arterion wrote:</div> was more looking for tips on people skills -- something computer guys aren't always so good at</blockquote><br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm on the other side. I'm the business owner. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOk - I'm going to do what I said I wouldn't and give you some advice. You need to speak to the owner and find out why he's hostile to change. It could be that he's not aware of what you can do for him - or it could be that he has a valid reason (and I suspect it'll come down to cost) why he doesn't want to reimplement things.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe only way you can move forward from this is to talk to him, and get an understanding of his opinions and reasonings. Along the way, hopefully, you'll help him to understand your position and concerns. Be prepared when you talk to him - don't be pushy or aggressive and be honest with him, and keep it friendly. Don't give him ultimatums. If he's in any way reasonable, then this could be a very productive session for both of you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope this helps and good luck. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\">  <small>Deja View - the feeling that you've seen this post before.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<p><a href=\"http://peteohanlon.wordpress.com\">My blog</a> | <a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/script/articles/list_articles.asp?userid=213147\">My articles</a></p></small><br />\r\n</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2008-08-15T16:02:00","modifiedDate":"2008-08-15T16:02:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2015-10-19T06:19:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2680624/Re-Advice-Working-for-a-Small-Business","apiLink":"","parentId":2680605,"threadId":2677582,"indentLevel":3},{"id":"2682194","title":"Re: Advice: Working for a Small Business","authors":[{"name":"Mycroft Holmes","id":2509569}],"summary":"Take Pete's advice, what you have brought up here is what you need to say to the management.

I've never posted here before, but I have read a lot of articles. I am a computer science student at the University of Central Florida. I have a project for my technical writing class that I need help with. I have to write a fake application letter and resume for a real job that I might qualify for. I need to have a professional in my field (software development) review the letter and resume and give me some pointers on improvement. I don't know anybody in my field so I was hoping somebody here could read over these documents and give me some pointers on format, content, and some practical advice for a computer science student looking for his first job.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf anybody would help me I would really appreciate it. I am a little apprehensive about asking busy people to have to do homework, but it is a requirement for the assignment. If anybody decides to help, thank you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'll copy and paste the letter below and copy and paste the resume below the letter.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n---------- LETTER ----------<br />\r\n<br />\r\n121 Fake Address Road Apt 9309<br />\r\nDaytona Beach, FL 32119<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMarch 2, 2008<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNancy Hanrahan<br />\r\nRaydon Corporation<br />\r\n210 Fentress Blvd.<br />\r\nDaytona Beach, FL 32114<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAttention: Human Resource Department<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDear Ms. Hanrahan:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am applying to the entry level Software Engineer position I saw advertised on the Raydon website. I am currently a senior at the University of Central Florida and finishing a Co-Op term at United Space Alliance. I believe the combination of my Co-Op experience and formal education makes me a strong candidate for this position.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile studying computer science at the University of Central Florida I realized that in a dynamic industry like software development, experience is crucial. I knew experience would supplement my formal education immensely. I didn’t hesitate when I was accepted for the Co-Op program at United Space Alliance. The opportunity required me to work full time every other semester. This extended my time in college but I believe the experience has prepared me for positions such as the one you are offering. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAt United Space Alliance I’ve worked on projects that solved real world problems without well defined means towards a solution. I have conceptualized, designed, coded, tested, debugged, and documented my projects under limited supervision. Software development can be an expensive, challenging, and lengthy process. With this in mind, I understand the need for innovation, motivation, and the accurate and timely delivery of projects. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn your company profile you say that the products you develop help save lives. At United Space Alliance, it was crucial that everybody understood how potentially unsafe it could be if we did not take the work we did seriously. One of the mottos at United Space Alliance was producing work that was safe, error free, and on time. I believe these are important qualities for any work, especially for the products you produce at Raydon.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn closing, I want to ensure you that I am willing to work as hard as it takes to exceed your expectations. I understand that this position requires candidates to meet and exceed certain qualifications. I hope I can have a chance to meet with you in person and discuss if I could be an addition to your team of software engineers. Thank you for your time.

The better approach to take for this is to use what is called a functional resume. This style lists experience in skills clusters rather than chronologically by employer and is great for someone that doesn't have a lot of real-world experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, for a resume that is light in experience, you can also list outside activities like usergroups, etc. if you are invovled in any (and they are relevant to the work).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs both Pete and Paul point out, you also have to balance a fine line between \"selling\" yourself to the HR manager and the hiring manager (usually the technical manager).

A couple of the suggestions here are good ones - see if you can use the generated code so long as it adequately supports the projects it's being used for, look into licensing if required, and use any downtime you have (it may not be for awhile, of course) to dissect and rebuild areas that end up requiring it due to generated code limitations.

You see, I used to code every day, all of my time was spent on eating, sleeping, and coding.

I coded a new game engine, a game using that engine, and a very neat GUI system for that game - in less than 4 days. The GUI thing I thought was impossible for someone of my skill level, but it just came natural, I didn't worry at all about not being able to finish it. Didn't get \"stuck\" or anything. I coded it and enjoyed coding more than ever.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut now I'm back to zombieing... damn. So, has anyone else gone through this? Any tips? My dad has some Focus Factor pills, maybe that helps?

It's an interesting experience being an immigrant. You are definitely second class so things like getting a Visa card, a car loan and an apartment can be a hassle. Use the accent wisely - it will get you far.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. It's cold. No - I mean really, really, Oh My God I Can't Believe People Live Here cold.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3.

From what I've seen this is actually detrimental to productivity because everyone's stressed out and unmotivated. At the risk of really pissing a few people off, from what I've seen and heard from friends there is a lot of \"it's not my problem\" and \"it's not my fault\" in some companies.

They will possibly even hunt me down and beat me up with hockey sticks but one of the greatest forms of entertainment is sitting around with Canadian friends after a few drinks listening to them get worked up about how the Americans think they say \"oot and aboot\". \"We say oot, not oot.

You are a freelancer, you have an ongoing customer who gives you work every month. He needs something new developed, which is a new ground for you (needless to say it's new to the customer as well). You have to learn (read a manual/tutorial and try something out first) before you will be able to accomplish the task. You are paid an hourly rate and charge for time spent working. Should you charge for time spent learning something which you need in order to finish the task?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI couldn't find almost nothing on Google, from the results of my research there are a few ways taken by different people:<br />\r\n- some will charge the normal rate<br />\r\n- some will lower the rate<br />\r\n- some will not charge<br />\r\n- some will raise the rate<br />\r\n<br />\r\nLowering or not charging is understandable because you feel it would be not fair to charge the customer for something you can't do right now.

Every now and then you have to improve your skills and learn a new technology you will need for the next project. But the difference I see is when you are a full time employee the boss wouldn't fire you because you didn't know something, then hire somebody else to do the job, then fire him and hire you again. <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_wink.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Wink | ;)\" />  But freelancing is different - he can hire anybody just for this one project, can't he?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPeople who raise the rate...

After the initial hand-off, additional emails, IMs, or phone calls ensue as more questions arise. Never are there complains or attitude from my co-workers.

It is better to move across to languages where there is a good overlap with web design. That way existing skills can be transferred and new skills are built on an existing foundation. To dig out that foundation and start from a big hole in the ground is a waste of time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChances are that the shift to software development is to facilitate a career change also. That being the case the OP would want something that is immediately marketable. C++ was the language of choice 10 years ago. Not so much today. And a lot of companies want people with web design AND software development skills to help bridge the gap between designers and developers. It is much better in that scenario to learn a language that helps bridge the gap. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\"><hr><small>Upcoming FREE developer events:<br />\r\n* Glasgow: <a href=\"http://www.scottishdevelopers.com/modules/extcal/event.php?event=7\">SQL Server Managed Objects AND Reporting Services</a> ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>My <a href=\"http://www.colinmackay.net\">website</a></b></small></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-10-30T16:06:00","modifiedDate":"2007-10-30T16:06:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-11-26T15:53:00","rating":5.0,"votes":2,"popularity":1.50515,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2296144/Re-Want-to-become-a-programmer","apiLink":"","parentId":2295995,"threadId":2294526,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"2297166","title":"Re: Want to become a programmer","authors":[{"name":"Fatbuddha 1","id":2866602}],"summary":"I thought of C++ in order to learn programming, because I think if you continue writing code in Java or C# for web apps.

It is great that some language have certain patterns built in. By your logic we should learn assembly because the loop pattern isn't built in. You have to use conditional jump instructions, hand craft your own counters and so on to do the same thing. All C# is doing is continuing the trend.

Hardware near programming, stuff like that. Also I really got in the algorithmic thinking, or how ever you want to call this.  Then we learned Java and last but not least C#. A also did some projects in Java and C#, not that you think I might be fresh from school <img src=\"https://codeproject.freetls.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" /> <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAfter looking back I think I gain the most experience in C++. Because there I really get to know what differences it makes if you do it in different ways. Also I have to say that it isn't the easierst language, it can be sometimes quiet anoying for sure! but after all, you really have to take care of every little bit and thats what I liked in terms of learning. I mean if you go for C#, just to program a little you have to know more or less about object oriented programming. Also true for java I think, also with java you wont get help in this forum, because I think the last entry is from last year or so<img src=\"https://codeproject.freetls.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" /> .<br />\r\nSo if we look in respect of this forum there are mostly two languages suported, C++ and C#, true?<br />\r\nSuch that I think for a web developer it doesn´t make sence to go for C# because the risk is high that he stays in web Abbs and don't be force to programm general algorithms. For example a sorted dictonary in C, is for example a nice App do do , if you start.<br />\r\nSome of this sort, because I think there you gain a lot and you can play a lot of algorithmic thinking. I hope you know what I mean. <br />\r\nIn C#, it is easy to \"cheat\", because you have the class already in. So when he plays with lists and double linked lists, trees and concepts of that and how they can be used efficiently, than he can quickly build up something where he has all the features of what you where talking and he is kind of forced to use them correctly.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd by the way, I don´t know if i missed it or not. But what would be you suggestion according to starter language?<br />\r\nCheers<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\">You have the thought that modern physics just relay on assumptions, that somehow depends on a smile of a cat, which isn’t there.( Albert Einstein)</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-11-26T15:52:00","modifiedDate":"2007-11-26T15:52:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-11-26T15:53:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2335620/Re-Want-to-become-a-programmer","apiLink":"","parentId":2334011,"threadId":2294526,"indentLevel":13},{"id":"2293376","title":"Questions about Recruitment","authors":[{"name":"Colin Angus Mackay","id":22542}],"summary":"I'm doing a <a href=\"http://blog.colinmackay.net/archive/2007/10/17/638.aspx\">session on Recruitment</a>[<a href=\"http://blog.colinmackay.net/archive/2007/10/17/638.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>] at <a href=\"http://www.developerday.co.uk\">DDD6</a>[<a href=\"http://www.developerday.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>] and I'm looking for some questions to put to the panel.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have any question about recruitment that you'd liked answered by an expert please let me know. <a href=\"http://blog.colinmackay.net/archive/2007/10/17/638.aspx\">Details about the session are here</a>[<a href=\"http://blog.colinmackay.net/archive/2007/10/17/638.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Window\">^</a>] <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\"><hr><small>Upcoming FREE developer events:<br />\r\n* Glasgow: <a href=\"http://www.scottishdevelopers.com/modules/extcal/event.php?event=7\">SQL Server Managed Objects AND Reporting Services</a> ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>My <a href=\"http://www.colinmackay.net\">website</a></b></small></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-10-29T10:12:00","modifiedDate":"2007-10-29T10:12:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-10-29T10:12:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2293376/Questions-about-Recruitment","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":2293376,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"2289183","title":"The Job Hunt","authors":[{"name":"DRAYKKO","id":3957492}],"summary":"Hi All:<br />\r\nI'm just starting out in my software development career (making a lateral move from systems analyst to developer) and I was wondering if anyone has compiled a cheat sheet of the most common tech interview questions that can be asked.

It would therefore seem to be prudent to learn the system that is gaining ground and needs more DBAs than the system that is losing ground.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSQL Server also comes in many flavours. SQL Server Express is free. It is well documented and there are several user groups where support from ones peers is available. If you want to learn the enterprise level features then the Developer Edition costs just $49 which is identical to the Enterprise edition but for two things. First it can also run on Windows XP or Vista (Enterprise Edition cannot) and second the licence only permits use for development and testing. Naturally, when putting those skills to use in a comercial environment the final deployed solution would be on a full license.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally, the OP asked the question on a Microsoft centric website. That suggests that the OP is self-selecting a choice to just what Microsoft offer. That is Access or the plethora of SQL Server Editions. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\"><hr><small>Upcoming FREE developer events:<br />\r\n* Glasgow: <a href=\"http://www.scottishdevelopers.com/modules/extcal/event.php?event=7\">SQL Server Managed Objects AND Reporting Services</a> ...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<b>My <a href=\"http://www.colinmackay.net\">website</a></b></small></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-10-30T16:15:00","modifiedDate":"2007-10-30T16:15:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-10-30T16:15:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2296164/Re-What-would-I-do-to-become-a-database-administra","apiLink":"","parentId":2296004,"threadId":2287334,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"2280357","title":".Net Contractors - suitable interview questions","authors":[{"name":"Mel Padden","id":2952619}],"summary":"I've just been employed (about three months ago) by a large corp, as a .NET senior dev, after working my way through a few standard dev jobs over the last few years.

I am sure many of you will read this and sigh, because this is the same question that I have seen a dozen times on here.  I am going to approach this in a hopefully different way, so my simple question may be a bit longer than usual, but the core of it is \"what do I do from here\"?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have been on and off reading/lab programming for a while now (boardering on a year).  It wasn't until a few months ago that I became a lot more serious about my intent to participate.  I've started tackling the OOP understanding barrier, studying and testing ideas pretty much every night of the week.  I have a non-tech degree (management) and I am a little older than the average programmer new to the field (30).  I feel like my knowledge is progressing well, but I am still not quite ready yet.  My language of choice is C# based on the recommendation of a good friend who is a senior programmer and a named company (I know the community is tightly tied together, so I would rather not say where).  Needless to say, my best freind has become my mentor.  We work on my code and dress it up so that I understand how my code can be better prepared.  I feel like I will still need a year to learn up to a comprable level at the casual study rate.  However, now that I am seeing a sort of path, I have found that I am programming more and more, and willingly stepping outside of the boundaries of what I know to see if I can just build random items.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHere is what I know at the moment:<br />\r\nBasic class structures, loops, arrays, and I am working on base classes in C#.  This gives me the ability (tied with the VS developer) to create very simple but functional programs.  I will begin to work on SQL and ADO shortly (probably another month).  However, I want to really start stepping up.  I think that I want to go into applications development based on the following facts: web development has a home in PHP and Javascript as well, and I am not really ready for that sort of versatility just yet.  I realized that I need to keep focused on the .Net group of languages for a while.  In order, I intend to expand my C# development skills much further and this is my primary goal, following with SQL(T-SQL), ADO, and then ASP in their respective .Net form.  So basically I am a semi-functional beginner.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nBut here is where I was hoping that some people could give me ideas, part of the challenge that I have discovered is that as a beginning programmer I am now stuck in a middle place.  I am a little more advanced than the basic stuff like loops, so the beginning classes are not good for me, and the advanced classes are still just out of my range.  I want to get out there and code!  Play QA or something to get some real time in and start developing.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrom what I understand most of the people that graduate college have little more than a theoretical understanding of programming concepts, although I am sure there are many of you out there that popped out of the womb as pros, so please don't take that as an insult.  I'm a very rapid learner, and don't have to ask twice.  If any of you have any sources where I can start to develop additional applications, I would appreciate it.  My ideas are simply not complex enough to challenge me anymore (you can't create something greater than yourself, is the way it was told to me), and honestly my friend has better things to do with his life than always answer my questions or design more stuff for me to do.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have heard a few suggestions about elance and things like that, but when I search there, they want pros like you guys (as I would too), and they are not really there except to get a job done (the point of outsourcing).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo again, any thoughts that you have for me, good or bad, are accepted and appreciated.  I just want to get out there and get a job in the end, and at this point the only way to do that is to churn out more code.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks again for your help <img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" />  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\">Beginning Programmer - Still learning as much as possible.</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-10-17T13:41:00","modifiedDate":"2007-10-17T13:41:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-11-21T14:30:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2276722/The-same-old-question","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":2276722,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"2276947","title":"Re: The same old question","authors":[{"name":"Pete O'Hanlon","id":213147}],"summary":"How refreshing this post was. Coherent. Well thought out and to the point. More importantly, you laid out your skill levels well and indicated the areas where you want to progress. So how can you go about this? Well, probably the best way to do this is to go out and code. I know that this seems to be obvious, but it's surprising how few people actually think it through. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nObviously, CP has so many good articles on coding that you should be downloading and playing with some of the samples. I'm going to make a really suggestion here - find a project that hasn't been touched in a while (preferably a .NET 1 article) and bring it up to date in .NET 2. Pick a project that is reasonably well written, but looks to have been left on the shelf for a year or so. What you get here is a base to start from, and you can bring your own programming personality to bear on it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you have problems, then feel free to post questions on the forums and we will do our best to help out with this.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nNow - you need to learn about things like patterns. Pick up a couple of good tutorials on patterns and see if you can redo the work using patterns. I'd be surprised if you couldn't find at least a couple of patterns that you could use.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you need help on choosing a project, pick a couple that you think that you might want to take a look at and post the links. We'll take a look and say if we think that the skill level is too great.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nGood luck - and I hope we see more of you. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\"><small>Deja View - the feeling that you've seen this post before.<br />\r\n</small></div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-10-17T15:55:00","modifiedDate":"2007-10-17T15:55:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-11-21T14:30:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2276947/Re-The-same-old-question","apiLink":"","parentId":2276722,"threadId":2276722,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"2276958","title":"Re: The same old question","authors":[{"name":"Nekosohana","id":4490825}],"summary":"Will do!

exam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthere are specific books from microsoft press for the preparation of exams. read out that book.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nbelow are some sample questions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1.<br />\r\nYou are a Web developer for Techno Inc. You create an ASP.NET application that accesses sales and marketing data. The data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server 2000 database on a server named TestK01.The company purchases a factory automation software application. The application is installed on TestK01, where it creates a second instance of SQL Server 2000 named Factory and a<br />\r\ndatabase named FactoryDB. You connect to FactoryDB by using Windows Integrated<br />\r\nauthentication.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou want to add a page to your ASP.NET application to display inventory data from FactoryDB. You use a SqlConnection object to connect to the database. You need to create a connection string to FactoryDB in the instance of SQL Server named Factory on TestK01. Which string should you use?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA. “Server=TestK01;Data Source=Factory;<br />\r\nInitial Catalog=FactoryDB;Integrated Security=SSPI”<br />\r\nB. “Server= TestK01;Data Source=Factory;<br />\r\nDatabase=FactoryDB;Integrated Security=SSP1”<br />\r\nC. “Data Source= TestK01\\Factory;Initial Category=Factory;<br />\r\nIntegrated Security=SSP1”<br />\r\nD. “Data Source= TestK01\\Factory;Database=FactoryDB;<br />\r\nIntegrated Security=SSP1”<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: D<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplanation:<br />\r\nThe Data Source attribute of the connection string contains the name, instance or network address of the instance of SQL Server to which to connect. In this scenario we are to connect to the Factory Instance on TestK01 so we use TestK01\\Factory as data source. To specify the database we should either use the Database or the Initial Catalog attribute. Here we use Database=FactoryDB.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2.You are creating an ASP.NET application for Techno Inc's Internet Web site. You want to create a toolbar that will be displayed at the top of each page in the Web site. The toolbar will contain only static HTML code. The toolbar will be used in only your application. You plan to create the toolbar as a reusable component for your application. You need to create the toolbar as quickly as possible.<br />\r\nWhat should you do?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nA. Create a new Web Control Library project.<br />\r\nCreate the toolbar within a Web custom control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nB. Add a new Web user control to your ASP.NET project.<br />\r\nCreate the toolbar within the Web user control.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nC. Add a new Web Form to your ASP.NET project.<br />\r\nUse HTML server controls to design the toolbar within the Web Form and save the Web Form with an .ascx extension.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nD. Add a new component class to your ASP.NET project.<br />\r\nUse HTML server controls to design the toolbar within the designer of the component class.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnswer: B<br />\r\n<br />\r\nExplanation:<br />\r\nWeb user controls enable you to easily define controls as you need them for your applications, using the same programming techniques that you use to write Web Forms pages.<br />\r\n<br />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-08-15T01:17:00","modifiedDate":"2007-08-15T01:17:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-08-15T01:17:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2182746/Re-MCSD-Visual-Csharp-Net-Core-Exam-Window-Applica","apiLink":"","parentId":2181421,"threadId":2172017,"indentLevel":3},{"id":"2157072","title":"Outlook 2003","authors":[{"name":"scorp_scorp","id":2844856}],"summary":"Hello All..<br />\r\nAm trying to configure my e mail account on outlook 2003, but am facing a problem: cannot connect to outgoing mail server, while connection to ingoing mail server is OK, (i can receive but can't send), bare in mind that both servers are same, and i didnt mistaken in spelling.<br />\r\nMore clarification: I tried to configure it on another PC, on the same network, things gone fine, i could receive and send, also my team mate can.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt is only on my PC, I tried alot but no result i checked the spelling, confirmed the password, everything, so i suspect that may be there is some configuration that i must do before? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlz help, Urgent...<br />\r\nBest Regards. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\nScorpion.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-07-30T04:18:00","modifiedDate":"2007-07-30T04:18:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-07-30T16:06:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2157072/Outlook-2003","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":2157072,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"2157909","title":"Re: Outlook 2003","authors":[{"name":"Brian Lowe","id":642418}],"summary":"If the POP3 server is the same as the SMTP server then the differentiator is the port.

I would say at least half of the people that hold MS certs shouldn't really have them as they did nothing more than study books for months, go to boot camps, or \"brain dump\" sites/training. All of this is done to collect initials to put after their name in an effort to make themselves look better and/or demand a higher pay than what is deserved.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf I interview someone that says they have MS credentials I tend to grill them harder on those areas. The more certs someone has, the less likely they are to have any real world experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd yes, that is a generalization. I know several people that have multiple certs that do honestly deserve them and do actively work in those areas, and really know there stuff; but that is becoming an ever increasing minority. And yes, I do have an MS cert, which took me 14 years of real experience to finally decide to go after it, passing all 3 exams on the first try without studying. The cert should be about what you know from everyday experience and use, not how much you can cram in order to pass. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div class=\"ForumSig\"><br />\r\nScott.<br />\r\n<hr style=\"height: 1px; width: 100%\">—In just two days, tomorrow will be yesterday.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n[<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/scrapbook/ForumGuidelines.asp\" target=\"_new\">Forum Guidelines</a>] [<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/script/articles/list_articles.asp?userid=157870\" target=\"_new\">Articles</a>] [<a href=\"http://geekswithblogs.net/sdorman\" target=\"_new\">Blog</a>]</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2007-09-13T22:41:00","modifiedDate":"2007-09-13T22:41:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2007-09-13T22:41:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/2226968/Re-NET-Certification","apiLink":"","parentId":2122566,"threadId":2099859,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"2099422","title":"Interviews - like winning the lottery","authors":[{"name":"minimice","id":524082}],"summary":"Hi all, I got headhunted by google, went through the 2nd round of interviews and they later informed me I wasn't a fit according to their requirements but told me to apply for other positions.

A lot depends on the customer, it can be frustrating if they call you every day with trivial little problems that require you to visit their office. (A good remote desktop connection is a must, both to their servers and their desktop machines).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere isn't much money in it as a stand-alone gig as you'll never be able to match the prices that some IT companies do.

Please let me know if I'm posting in the wrong place.  I'm developing my very first software for a medical research group.  The software itself is not overly complex, its basically a front for connecting to a database.  Not the hardest thing to do I admit, but I'm finally getting my feet wet in programming since graduating college (B.S. Computer Engineering).  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnyhow, said group is going to pay me for my time and effort for the program.  But thus far its been a very informal situation.  My day job is to be the group's office administrator, fellowship coordinator and receptionist (don't ask...it pays my bill and is helping me through grad school right now).  I'm not completely naive, and my concern is should I have a contract in place?  If so, what types of terms would be reasonable?  I imagine this program will need to be updated with a new version at some point in time (the researchers are having a hard time making up their mind what the \"vision\" of the program is)...and should I be rightfully concerned that without a contract that I'm locking myself into years of maintaining this software without additional pay.  I completely trust and respect the researchers...but at the end of the day, I know it comes down to how much in research budget they have left and friendships be darned.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then the next question is does this mean that I'm a self-employed person contracting myself out?

After I talked to the manager he said that he would have given me enough to cover the classes if that was all they had asked for.  So talk to them about things and how you feel there.

I was on the team that worked directly with WIPRO and WIPRO was writing are new manufacturing project management system. It was huge with terrabyte databases in memory (using perl), C++ middleware and VB 6.0 front-ends. My job was to qualify all the code coming in from WIPRO and sign-off that it was ready to go into our manufacturing system for production. Keep in mind 1 hour of downtime in 1 facility = $1 million in loss and that's on the conservative side.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo to begin with their production system V 1.0 had no error handlers in any of the code anywhere. None. I reported this and they sent the VB 6.0 code back in less than 1 hour and they had put this in every sub/method/function<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOn Error GoTo ErrorHandler<br />\r\n<br />\r\nErrorHandler:<br />\r\nResumeNext<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat was how things started. Well not really. My boss and I had been battling it out with them for months because of differences in what Americans (us) felt was quality software that was well written and what WIPRO (them) felt was well-written quality software. We wanted a minimum of 2 levels of redundancy in non MFG critical code and 3 or 4 levels in MFG critical code. WIPRO was reluctant to provide even 1 level even though in the analysis and requirements document that we received from them multiple levels of redundancy were spelled out in clear terms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt just went back and forth like that. We had to fight tooth and nail for every feature. Then when they released the code to us I found issues in every single release from the PERL, C++ and VB none of it was done right every. So we'd ship it back and say it was wrong. Fight with them on why. I cannot count the times I had to stay up late in the night and haggle it out with OFFSHORE over why something wasn't going to work. In some cases they would ship code that would not work at all with their other code. We'd explain this and they'd say well we cannot release our beta code that we've upgraded to it's not ready. So they would claim they met the release on time but really they didn't the other half of the system wasn't done but because the frontend was they they felt they met their deadline.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt was so tedious to work with them. I spent more time fixing their code then I spent writing my own. Here's the final kicker. I wrote Microns memory build and hot-lot tracking system it was a world-wide application and in the 3 years I owned it my downtime due to my code was less than .0001%. WIPRO took it over after I left and in 6 months downtime in that system was up to 20%. That really sealed it for me. Then I talked with my peers at Albertsons who also had to work with WIPRO and their story was identical. Junk, garbage, worthless stuff coming from WIPRO.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I decided then and there to wash my hands of anything to do with WIPRO ever again.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Rex<br />\r\n<div class=\"CPhogPost\"></div> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<hr><font size=\"2\" color=\"Green\"><b>The enemy's gate is down.</b></font><img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_cool.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Cool | :cool:\" /> <br><br />\r\n<small><b>Welcome to CP</b> in your language.

I had just finished about 6 months of working 100 hour work weeks on a project spanning almost a year that really kicked up in the end.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI left my first post in tact because so many people had read it. I'm going to go remove the stuff about Indian contractors because it's really not applicable. My previous on-site job where the communication was face-to-face is what I was thinking and that simply won't be the case with this. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nYou seem to have formed several opinions about me all of them wrong and that's fine. I cannot change the way you think. Unfortunately you are on a bender for me and I'm not interested in playing dodge-ball with you. Like you pointed out I do have work to do. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI am not anti-Indian, anti-redneck, anti-anything. I'm very tired, I have to much work and I want to displace it off on people I can trust. If you are at all interested in that feel free to let me know. I'm quite happy to move right past where things are and directly into where things could be. I'm getting ready to launch an advertisement in a local business publication that will likely net a lot more work for me. Of that work I'd like to marshall almost all of it here to the CP consortium that gets formed. I'm hoping that in time other developers/freelancers/consultants will also start to advertise and attract work and we all can stay very happy, very busy and not have to have employees.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI and others have there own web servers and if not on mine then on someone's I'd like to setup version control, multi-project issue-feature management (Developer-side and user-side.) I'd like to have an environment where new people interested in joining can post resume type data, links to their work, etc.. as well as sections where individual projects are scoped out, delegated, delivered, deployed and supported.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSomeday adapting VS TEAM SYSTEM might also be kind of fun. The sky is the limit on this and I want to see where it all goes. I'm going to guess you have the tallent/skills/abilities to be part of it and if you are interested just let me know. I deserve (in some ways) the harassment you have provided so far and that harassment has caused me to change my post as I have zero wish to exclude anyone based upon race, religion or gender nor the ability to speak audibly. What if a def individual wanted work? How would I manage that? I couldn't. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo anyway. There's my vision that is growing and changing by the moment.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nP.S. - The project was enormous the 500 hours in phone calls were virtual meetings, walk-throughs, functionallity reviews, change reviews and a bunch of other stuff that involved about 30 people traveling constantly in various parts of the world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- Rex<br />\r\n<div class=\"CPhogPost\"></div> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<hr><font size=\"2\" color=\"Green\"><b>The enemy's gate is down.</b></font><img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_cool.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Cool | :cool:\" /> <br><br />\r\n<small><b>Welcome to CP</b> in your language.

Also even if you get a raise (probably the bare minimum your boss thinks he can get away with) you just know your not going to get another one for a VERY long time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour boss wants to do the best for the company which means paying the staff as little as they can get away with. You on the other hand probably dont give a rats arse about the company but you want to do the best for yourself and your family, which means getting the most pay you can possibly get (a bit of job satisfaction is nice but it wont put food on the table). These 2 views dont exactly compliment each other so really the answer is simple:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you like your job and will put up with the pay - Stay<br />\r\nIf you want more pay (Ever) - Leave<br />\r\n<br />\r\nJon","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2006-04-03T10:43:00","modifiedDate":"2006-04-03T10:43:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2006-04-03T10:43:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/1434117/Re-Salary-Increases-w-out-chaning-jobs","apiLink":"","parentId":1419650,"threadId":1419650,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"1382950","title":"ASP .Net C# 2005 Developers Needed Immediately...

But I have been programming for 14 years in other programming languages.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I am trying to teach myself C#. I would like to take a test in C# to prove to myself and to prospective employers that I have a certain level of compentency in C#. I have no work experience with C#. I have one online source for C# (learnvisualstudio.com) that is a fairly cheap and descent source for teaching myself C#. I also have 3-4 C# books to help.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I looked into the Microsoft Certification and there is a new path to follow that involves something called MCPD (with specialties in Web or Windows or Enterprise). Many of the test are in beta or about to be released in the next few months.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe problem is that I have been told that the test 70-548 replaces the 70-315. But when I look at the skills that will be measured by the 70-548 I immediately run into trouble. The first skill talks about \"proof of concept\". I have no idea what proof of concept is. I did find some microsoft papers and it looks like proof of concept is along the lines of building a prototype? I am tempted to take the 70-315, but it is not based upon .net 2.0. I am going to post a separate question on proof-of-concept... but it is a good example of my frustration.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo I feel a bit lost right now in my direction. I could just keep on studying the 4-5 C# books that I have and be ok with this. But I was hoping to take some sort of test to prove my knowledge.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnother option I am exploring is taking a class because putting the class on my resume, or being able to say I took a class might instill some confidence in a prospective employer (and maybe myself also).<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAny advice from anyone?

However, the exact procedure you choose depends a lot on what type of file you are working with and what kind of chnages you plan to make.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFor example, if you plan to create a custom action using an Installer class, you may not always get the results you expect.  Suppose you decide a simple approach is to create an Installer class custom action that copies the file in question to some temporary location and simply copies it back to the Common folder during uninstall.  This will not work as you expect, because Installer class based custom actions are run at the end of the install.  This means the original file has already been replaced during the installation, so what would happen is you would copy the new file to the temporary copy, then restore the new file again, effectively accomplishing nothing different than marking the file permanent.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo an alternative would be to simply not install the file at all.  Instead write a custom action that amends the existing file with your changes, then removes those changes from the amended file during uninstall.  This approach is viable if the file is a simple text file etc. but would be pretty difficult to implement if the file is binary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDepending on what exactly you need to do, you may need to embed the custom action as a DLL rather than using the NET Installer class.  This is a lot more flexible approach - you can for example control exactly when the custom action executes, you are not limited to an action that always runs at the end of the sequence.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPost some more details and maybe I can offer some specific suggestions.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2005-09-12T18:02:00","modifiedDate":"2005-09-12T18:02:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2005-09-13T13:57:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/1223883/Re-Creating-msi-packages-in-net","apiLink":"","parentId":1219678,"threadId":1219678,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"1224387","title":"Re: Creating msi packages in .net","authors":[{"name":"Andrew Porter","id":360895}],"summary":"I am just need to amend and xml configuration file with the common files folder, nothing major","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2005-09-13T06:42:00","modifiedDate":"2005-09-13T06:42:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2005-09-13T13:57:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/1224387/Re-Creating-msi-packages-in-net","apiLink":"","parentId":1223883,"threadId":1219678,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"1224755","title":"Re: Creating msi packages in .net","authors":[{"name":"rwestgraham","id":1684087}],"summary":"I would try using the NET Installer class to do something like this.

They set technical tests and get their own answers wrong. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. They ask you what your weaknesses are. Would Tony Blair tell you what his weaknesses are? He was asked a similar question on the BBC Today programme and answered: “that’s for me to know and you to find out.” <br />\r\n<br />\r\n4.

They give as a reason for rejecting you after interview that you do not have adequate experience in skill X when it wasn’t asked for in the first place. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n6.

Human Resources (aka Human Remains) interview you and ask you lots of stupid questions, none of which have any relevance to whether you can do the job. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n9. The job is a contract position and they insist on knowing your career aims for the next 20 years. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n10.

You have 10 years’ solid IT industry experience, yet they insist on your having a 1st class honours degree from Oxford, Cambridge or Imperial.

They ask you to give them an idea on how to proceed with the problem that is forcing them to look for a contractor in the first place. In other words, they want free consultancy as part of the interview. But once they’ve got the consultancy they hire someone else. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n13. They advertise a job that specifies that the candidate must have at least 3 years’, but no more than 10 years’, experience in C++. In other words, those aged over 35 need not apply. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n14. They insist that you have 2 years’ commercial experience in a new software technology that has yet to be released. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n15. You are rejected because you do not fit the “company culture.” In other words, you are too old. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n16. They say you must be able to write bug-free code as a matter of course. So their current software is bug-free then? <br />\r\n<br />\r\n17. They get the agency to give you a technical test over the phone. You pass this and they invite you to their offices.

If they want you they’ll make you an offer within 24 hours, either later that day or the next morning, regardless of whether they’ve got others to see. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n19. They think that if you haven’t got commercial experience in skill X then you can’t do it at all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n20. You have been a professional programmer for 10 years, but you don’t have commercial experience in the latest skill, X. Yet they treat you as though you are a brand new programmer with no commercial experience at all. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n21. They ask for a shopping-list of a dozen skills.

However I will pick up on a few points you could improve. Also, these are my opinions and potential employers may have their own opinions.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>To find a position as a programmer<br />\r\nin a field C++, MFC ATL, DCOM, DBMS,XML, Client/Server 2,3 tier, LAN/Internet programming</i><br />\r\nPersonally I don't like programmer, I think that \"software developer\" is a better description. If you get the chance you should tailor your CV for each employer so you can say \"C++ Software developer\" or whatever depending on the job you are going for. Also, you have 8 years experience, inserting the word \"senior\" might also appear better. Finally, on this section, your list of fields is too large. A potential employer or recuitment agency is going to think: \"We don't have any jobs that do all that.\" So, again try and taylor it to the individual application, or if you can't just list the most important one or two.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>Microsoft Certification:<br />\r\n...SCORE - 860 for 540 pass of 1000 total.</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis section is too verbose. Just give the name and number of the exam. Also, I'm an MCSD, and your score line make no sense to me. Did you get 860 out of 1000, if so, what does the 540 mean?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>EMPLOYMENT HISTORY</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis section mostly lists the technology that you used in each job. It doesn't actually say much about the job itself. If you are going for a permanent position (and if you are looking to relocate then I guess you are) then you need to give more about your duties and reponsibilities.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso, you mix the verb tenses which can make it a little jarring to read. e.g. \"System of data gathering, analyzing\" Vs. \"Provided COM subsystems\". Personally, I would prefer the first example to be changed to \"Gathered and analysed...\" because that is showing a past-action-now-completed and potential employers like to see you can complete stuff (even if it is on a subconsious level). The present continuous tense (-ing endings) make it sound like you are still working on it and the end date is somewhat fuzzy.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>please note that above is a most preferable specializations</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nRe-read your CV for small errors like this. \"is\" ==&gt; \"are\" because the word \"specializations\" is plural and the verb has to match with the noun it refers to.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>FOREIGN LANGUAGES:<br />\r\nFluent English</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nNot to your potential employer it isn't (if they are in an English speaking country). I'd change this just to read \"LANGUAGES: English, Russian\" (I'm assuming that is your first language)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFinally - I don't think this will make much of a difference, but some people can be really picky about this. Your CV is written in American English. If you are applying to other English speaking countries, like Britain, they might just reject you for using the wrong dialect. Although in the field of computing most of the terms use American spellings regardless of geography.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThis may not apply, BUT, be aware of your geography. You said you want to get a job in the US or England. You may have applied and were rejected from companies in the UK that were not in England because of this mistake. I've had letters addressed to me with the address as \"Edinburgh, England\" - Just lucky the postal service in England know that Edinburgh is in Scotland. A lot of people don't know that there are actually 3 countries on that island (England, Scotland and Wales), collectively known as Britain. If you don't know specifically that it is in England use Britain or British, it is safer and you don't run the risk of offending anyone. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<hr><p align=\"center\"><small><a href=\"http://blogs.wdevs.com/colinangusmackay/\" target=\"_blank&quot;\">Do you want to know more?</a><br />\r\n<a href=\"http://wdevs.com/\"><b>WDevs.com - Open Source Code Hosting, Blogs, FTP, Mail and Forums</b></a></small></p>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2005-02-03T16:29:00","modifiedDate":"2005-02-03T16:29:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2005-02-20T15:44:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/1030872/Re-Why-I-was-rejected-so-much-with-following-resum","apiLink":"","parentId":1030106,"threadId":1030106,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"1031158","title":"Re: Why I was rejected so much with following resume ?","authors":[{"name":"vgrigor1","id":1160991}],"summary":"REsume made on the send requirements from west companies:<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs more detail as possible.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSenior- means just high positioned,<br />\r\nwhile I want underline qualification.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFluent- also choice from combo, of Employer's demand.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2005-02-04T01:31:00","modifiedDate":"2005-02-04T01:31:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2005-02-20T15:44:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/1031158/Re-Why-I-was-rejected-so-much-with-following-resum","apiLink":"","parentId":1030872,"threadId":1030106,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"1031250","title":"Re: Why I was rejected so much with following resume ?","authors":[{"name":"Colin Angus Mackay","id":22542}],"summary":"<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>As more detail as possible</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf this was for an individual company try and figure out what they want from you and don't add in too much extra. I've been in a position where I was looking through CVs to find ones suitable to interview, the first stage is always to find something to immediately reject a potential candidate. Do not give them any reason to reject you. A CV I once rejected was on the grounds that it was too long and I didn't have time to read it. (Mind you it was about 12 pages).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTypically, in the US a résumé should be about 1 page, and in the UK a CV should be about 2 pages, anything more and you run the risk of rejection because of size.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>vgrigor1 wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>also choice from combo, of Employer's demand</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf this is from an online form then there is nothing you can do about including the word \"fluent\".

I don't know how well it'll work in other areas/countries (I'm in the southeastern US btw).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFirst and foremost, employers have to go through a TON of resumes/CVs nowadays. Programmers are a dime a dozen. Now, they have to weed out the bad ones, but that's not always easy when looking at over a hundred applications.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, the very top of your resume needs to be sales pitch.

And, don't tell them too much in it. Make them more curious about you and have them get in touch to find out more. Also, don't put so little they think this resume/CVs is a joke. It's walking a fine line, and you need to find it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThird, if you go into an interview, don't be timid. Most employers I know want an employee they like being around. You're selling your personality as well. Try to relax, but keep a sense of professionalism.

First let me start by saying that I used to work in NY for my company called (lets say X).I'm now in Missouri . There was a position in ST Louis Missouri for a Sr Systems Administrator so I took it because it looked like a good opportunity to live somewhere where you can afford a House . NY is so expensive especially on Long Island . So now I'm in Missouri ..In my group that I work with there is another Sr Systems Administrator so we are a team ..we are on the same level . There is also a systems administrator in my group that takes direction from both of us . Now here is where the ugly part is coming into play . The Sr systems admin that I work with is not doing his part to support the network and neglecting his duties (it seems its been this way before I got here) but doesn't want to admit that he doesn't do his job of course . We both report to a Manager in NY (cool right ? ) Well my relationship with my equal co-worker has gotten to the point that we don't talk to one another mainly cause we had a heated discussion on how he doesn't perform  his duties and I seem to be doing most or all the work related to our Job function . He is slow at completing tasks and sometimes I just don't know what he does and he sits in the cube right next to me . I'm not the type to lay judgement on anyone but when your at a certain level then you should perform to your abilities or at least try . So my problem is that I moved out here to Missouri and now I'm in an awkward position with this person . I have talked to my manager and asked for us to be separated in some way. I also explained allot of the things that been going on .He agreed mostly with what I had to say about this person and he said he would think about it and get back to me . I been with the company since 1997 . The only thing that is good is that I'm single not married have no kids . I do love this company I work for but I hit this road block . The problem person has been with the company for 15 years so I'm thinking that the company will not do anything about this .I think whats going to happen is that I am going to have to look for a new Job .. possibly I might want to move back to NY ... cause I miss it so much.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI just want to know if anyone ever had a similar experience and what did they do ... or if anyone had any advise .<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_confused.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Confused | :confused:\" /> <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks for reading <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChris<br />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2004-09-17T02:03:00","modifiedDate":"2004-09-17T02:03:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2004-09-20T13:25:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/926668/Im-having-a-problem-with-A-Co-worker","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":926668,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"926780","title":"Re: I'm having a problem with A Co-worker","authors":[{"name":"V.","id":1008736}],"summary":"Hi,<br />\r\nIn my opinion there's not much you CAN do:<br />\r\n1.

Any Advice???","authors":[{"name":"Steve Maier","id":2820}],"summary":"I would also have a few questions ready for them.  This way you can show them that you have prepared.  for my current position, I asked them about:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n- the use of IM<br />\r\n- about working from home during the winter (we can get alot of snow here)<br />\r\n- what is used for source control<br />\r\n- what type of process is used for the development<br />\r\n- how many meetings a week are there<br />\r\n- I also asked the hiring manager what technical websites / magazines does he read.  I thought of that one at the last minute, but it made the manager think for a minute.  I wanted to see how technical or pointy-haired he was.  Glad to see that he was a very technical manager.  During the interview he got his laptop and came to CP and checked out my articles that I had written.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne thing to think about when you do a technical interview is that there will be some people that talk to you that are non-technical people and then some others that will be programmers.  I had some non-technical people ask me to explain some technical things and I know that they would not know if I was right or not.  But that can be hard to tell.  Alot of times they just want to make you think about how you will approach the problem and how you go about getting things done.  You could be in left field with your actual information, but your way that you got there is important too.  Like the interview question about \"How many pizza places would you need if you were creating a new city, the size of LA, from scratch?\"  There is no right or wrong answer, just how you got there.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nOne last thing - be upfront about things.  If you don't know or can't remember something, tell them that.  This will help to eliminate some fumbling for the wrong answer.  And alot of technical people will understand that you can't know everything.  but them also tell them how you would go about looking it up, it that fit what they were asking. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSteve Maier, MCSD MCAD<br />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2004-09-13T11:50:00","modifiedDate":"2004-09-13T11:50:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2004-09-13T11:51:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/923015/Re-NET-Developer-Interview-Any-Advice","apiLink":"","parentId":906316,"threadId":905731,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"897576","title":"Extreme Programmers with C# experience needed","authors":[{"name":"bgcamps","id":726346}],"summary":"A company in Cleveland, OH is looking for degreed Extreme Programmers with strong C# and OOD skills.

On a windows app you can use message boxes and writing out to console windows and to debug files, but think about what you need to do from a web server perspective if the server is in a different state/country.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nDatabase access (like for SQL Server) is also important, not only for the exams but for using it in real life too.  Places that look at your cert will want to know that you can use their multi-cluster SQL Server with little effort.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso http://transcender.com/ has free sample exams that are pretty good.  I would download them and test your skills.  Of course the free version is only 1 practice exam and the full cost one is something like 5, but practice is practice. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nSteve Maier, MCSD MCAD<br />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2004-08-03T10:28:00","modifiedDate":"2004-08-03T10:28:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2004-08-03T11:08:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/888738/Re-MCAD-MCSD","apiLink":"","parentId":888410,"threadId":866531,"indentLevel":7},{"id":"888774","title":"Re: MCAD/MCSD","authors":[{"name":"exhaulted","id":972697}],"summary":"Thanks for your advice Steve, I've already done 70-316 and i would agree with you that there is going to be a lot of questions on Deployment and Debugging, as well as some ADO related questions.

My own has laws (which are frequently circumvented) about minimum wage levels; it also has punitive taxes (although they are not always called 'tax') which mean that it is less economic to have employees, so smaller companies are hit quite hard. There is the employer's National Insurance contributions which must be paid, plus a whole slew of other 'employee benefits', such as paternity leave, which impact on the performance of the business as a whole. (Before anyone points out that paternity leave is unpaid, bear in mind that the employer has to continue doing whatever they do while the employee is off bonding with their spouse and new-born).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInevitably, this pushes costs up, which pushes prices up, which makes bean-counters think \"Hmmm, we can outsource this and increase our take\".

However, if you asked to start out with a grade-7 step-2 pay, you'd already start out about $400 higher than the grade-6 step-5 pay, and could end up with as much as $38,767.

Most of the exciting development will lie in the \"algorithm\" and \"research\" part of the project cycle. For instance, we've had CAD/CAM, FEA (Finite Element Analysis) , CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) system around for a long time. But things are moving ahead. It's not a stagnant field. Example: Interaction with deformable 3D solid models in REALTIME with Data Gloves (Still in R&D phase last time I read about it in publication from UBC two years ago). How about reconstruction of 3D models from digital photos? This is possible by extending current image segmentation techonologies (edge detection, object recognition) and lotsa old school matrix algebra. But, it's already in mass production phase - Last time I saw in trade show a couple of years back. German manufacturer I think - they have cutting edge engineers - people who make their country proud. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are the stuff that the majority of us aren't doing. These are closed source advantage. These are the stuff that hasn't been devalued by Chinese/Indian competition, yet. But there're a lot of potential in these area - probably much more than trying to optimize area like processor scheduling. Web Dev is dead. Not that the technology is dead, quite the opposite indeed. But if you're looking at decreasing profit margin. On the other hand, things like network optimization seems to be much easier problems... easier to tackle, and faster to see real result (well, faster to see the end of the improvement too). I worked on a project with N??tel before. They were considering integrating financial metrics into their network management systems. That's perfectly doable - but it's easy to get duplicated at the same time. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nEnough babbling, time for me get back to work.

Here is my insight into my experience.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nScientific programming can be a nice place to be, if you can find the right niche market.  I market a software package to the disk drive industry.  There are not a lot of potential users, the hours are long, and you must be a jack of all trades (to put together marketing pamphlets, a user manual, a freindly GUI, all this in addition to the scientific skills you bring to the table).  In order to make ends meet I have to sell my product at a high price which  scares a lot of potential users.  If you have not already done so, you will spend a lot of time developing the product (without pay) so that it is marketable. Once you put your product on the market it will take an additional 3-6 months before people begin to purchase it.  Therefore, you will need some money in the bank to get you through the development phase and initial introduction phase.  Money does not come in in a predictable way, so there will be times when you just scrape by and others when you have a lot of money in the bank.  You will be caught in a cycle of never-ending updates.  I charge a yearly license for my software which does give some predictability to my finances.  You will have to handle all your tax issues (including self employment tax).  If you can afford it, find an office outside the home.  You will have to be extremely self-driven and work to find a balance between home life and work life.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe life style can be nice.  The hours are long (already mentioned that), but the freedom is wonderful.  You can take vacations when you want to.  If you have children, you can go and see them at school plays and the like without feeling guilty.  There is no boss, so you can work when you want and develop the program in whatever direction you want to which is very, very nice.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBefore owning my own business I worked for a small 5 man company that did scientific computing.  Working for yourself  is much better.  If you can find a company that is hiring someone with your background, however, then it can be a rewarding experience.  It is a lot of fun to work with others who are doing the same as you and to be able to bounce ideas around with them.  Small companies, though, can be very hard to work for.  Unless you have the best idea since sliced bread, money will always be tight and when you work for yourself or for a small operation, you will always be sorely aware of just how close you are to being out on the street.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI hope this helps<br />\r\n<br />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2003-12-17T09:56:00","modifiedDate":"2003-12-17T09:56:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2003-12-18T16:05:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/693513/Re-Scientific-Programming","apiLink":"","parentId":676502,"threadId":676502,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"694785","title":"Re: Scientific Programming","authors":[{"name":"Wjousts","id":49259}],"summary":"Thanks for your insight.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2003-12-18T16:04:00","modifiedDate":"2003-12-18T16:04:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2003-12-18T16:05:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/694785/Re-Scientific-Programming","apiLink":"","parentId":693513,"threadId":676502,"indentLevel":2},{"id":"674831","title":"Good on-line training program?","authors":[{"name":"Ken Galer","id":717709}],"summary":"I'm a electrical engineer that often writes embedded code in C for 8 and 16 bit microcontrollers.

What that says is, \"Regardless of what I do with the code in PlaceHolder that may impact my transaction, I choose to vote for committing it anyway.\"  That is to say, in general, you call EnableCommit *after* the body of your transaction-aware code has executed, to tell other participants in the transaction that your code is unaware of any reason not to commit.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSecond (and I am not a COM+ transaction authority), my understanding of AutoComplete versus EnableCommit is that AutoComplete is used to both ensure the creation of a transaction, and ensure that SetComplete is called if the tagged method returns normally(PlaceHolder in this case).  Marking the method as AutoComplete(true) suggests that PlaceHolder is the first and last bit of logic to use the created transaction.  Can't tell by your question, but I must assume there may be other methods called either before or after PlaceHolder that also intend to use the transaction.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSetComplete sets both the IsConsistent and IsDone bits on a transaction context, indicating that the transaction should proceed with the act of committing itself (bad news if other logic needs the transaction), while EnableCommit only sets the IsConsistent bit, allowing further code to use the transaction instead of trying to commit it immediately.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf PlaceHolder actually sits in the middle of other methods, all of which are intended for use in the same transaction context, setting EnableCommit at the end of PlaceHolder's execution would be the right choice with regards to transaction integrity. <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-style: italic; font-family: Arial; background-color: rgba(176, 196, 222, 1)\">The most exciting phrase to hear in science, the one that heralds the most discoveries, is not 'Eureka!'

I spent one day preparing for each exam: I scheduled each one for Monday at 10 AM, then started studying at around noon on Sunday and didn't let up until I left for the exam.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI think people are different, but in my experience it's better to study very hard over a shorter period of time than to study for many short periods spread out over a long span of time.  It's inevitable that some knowledge will be lost between short study sessions; I think that this knowledge is better cemented in place if more of it's taken at a time.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat I'm trying to say is that I don't seem to suffer a loss of knowledge after the fact with my method, even though some would call it cramming; in fact, much the opposite.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend just <i>one</i> session before each test, but you should also realize that a lot of the knowledge you gain in studying for these tests will never be useful to you.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI have seen lots of Microsoft-centered shops where the people ooh and ah over Microsoft certifications of any stripe, but in my experience the most well-known to the general public are (in order of descending importance)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMCSE<br />\r\nMCSA<br />\r\nMCDBA<br />\r\nMCSD<br />\r\nMCAD<br />\r\nMCP<br />\r\n<br />\r\nand then all the rest.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe bottom line is that all computer-related certifications are relatively easy to achieve (<i>even</i> Cisco certs), and they're not going to hurt your chances at all, unless you really don't know what to do with the stuff when you go for a technical interview with someone who <i>does</i> know.  In general, the best thing that you can hope for from a certification is to show some level of familiarity with a certain topic.  In my opinion, the resume format and interview are the most important factors when applying for a new job (although I try to stay highly certified all the time).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIt would also be bad to have ten different certifications on your resume, needless to say.  I would pick two or three certifications that you think wouldn't hurt to have, study intensely for a short time for each one and go confidently to take the exams, then not worry about it all again for a couple of years!

Please, e-ml me @ cincy2hot4u@hotmail.com, IF U R INTERESTED.  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHello, let me introduce myself first, I am Brian Edward Shepherd, 32, years YOUNG I am writing this because of what I feel is lacking on your hearts game, but I LOVE to play hearts, bridge, and Up N' Down the River, which ZONE, does not have, YET, but this note is regarding statistics! I feel you should keep, more in-depth statistics, which would improve my game play! I am hurt, so, I may be for this, which you cannot add, but I do not understand why not. They are STATISTICS, which I tested out of, in college at Miami University, Ohio! I also used to work on the NTT Project at Cincinnati Bell Information Systems. I believe zone.com, program CAN, and SHOULD be improved upon! I personally would volunteer my time and efforts on it. I would appreciate this VERY MUCH, as will many others! You could automate this, and SHOULD! I would like to keep as a statistic, an average final score, this can be done by storing the score you have at the completion of a game, divided by the total # games played. Along with this you should create a high score table, (in this Particular case, LOW SCORE Table). Please create a best scores table, because I believe I have scored a -64 as my BEST Score. I think you should create a high scores table too! Because, if I score high, this means I kept my score going and this should account for something! I would create a color schema, for how well, each player does, I would love to have this information! Start with Light, or light yellow - dark blue (My Eye color), you can create a banner with lights that show the top players. I know this would be a great advertisement section to put your advertisements up on the Top players screen! I KNOW I would like to know you would like to have this, create color schemas for how you play! Opportunity to place advertisements of your picture in your statistics file! So, as I remember some of my multiple requests, I will write you again! I believe that you should have a set # games to be played option also. Because, I truly CANNOT Stand these SINGLE games you play win/lose, I feel like you, should have a set number of games option, IT would help out, your steady players! I See I have NO ONE With the GUTS, to tell me, YES/NO. I will tell you, I have the fortitude to handle either way, but I am telling YOU how you CAN IMPROVE POGO. If you WANT to improve zone, statistically. Which I explain, what YOUR service is LACKING. NOW, is when you want to improve pogo! Now, since you will create this program code, I am your personal contact! THX. I do not KNOW what else I could do, for this to be created for you! As, if you would not reply, with a yes it will be created by Oct. 31, 2003, is ALL I want in return from my ingenious idea FOR zone, to be better than the zone. I have done this FREE OF charge for these statistics to be created for US All; I just want this done; I have just about quit writing you My great ideas. IF, this is created, which is hard for you, I guess, I want to be able to put up my own ads! Also, please create more tables to play at, because they are FULL, and I KNOW they are not full! Please, INVESTIGATE the optimum rule, because you can create a table when necessary, in the room. That is all for now, but I will probably have dreams tonight, about you creating this, and I will submit more inclusive of this request. I fore see storing what each player has done for their Previous xxxxxxx games would be awesome to keep records about! Thank you, for your supporting this handicap! See, I am working, THINKING, in your behalf!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nThat is all for now, but I will probably have dreams tonight, about you creating this, and I will submit more inclusive of this request.

See, I AM a working, THINKIN' Brian Edward Shepherd; your skills are being diminished typing all this. This Muslim was on-line AND VERY MUCH annoyed me, I would denote him A BLACK Flag to warn others of!!!!!!!!! He stalled a game, I won, and I could not boot him! Flags should be created where you assign certain colored flags to players who annoy you! You should have thought of this already!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nIt has happened twice to me, so far! FRUSTRATION, reigns! Green, Light for certain players you like to play - Black for players you totally don't want to see what they are doing! I think this should do already, but IF not, by July 4th! For OBVIOUS reasons! THX, for Being American! Sit down - Lakers! Welcome Spurs, and Tim Duncan! Hey, I just thought of something from the Basketball game! How about a scorer's table. I would like a high score list and low scores list, thus you would STRIVE to be on either of the lists, I know, I would be displayed on 1, of the lists! Top ten list @ least! PLEASE, you can have advertisers be displayed on a list! I think, I am finished, Shepherd Hearts Club that meet Fridays for the last 5 years, at my home my parents will treat you, AWESOME! I think, I am being dodged by you are NOT Giving any form of input! Pizzas and Mom prepares desserts for ALL, OF MY Guests, IF you Want to join my club, e-ml me @ cincy2hot4u@hotmail.com Duncan, IS Dunkin on U! OH, WELL ZONE CALLIN' MY NAME, so, I had better ANSWER THE Call! I want to RE-INFORCE in ur MIND that FLAGS are a necessary feature to your hearts game at least, but you should be able to transmit these ideas to ur Heart, Spade, Bridge, and Up N' Down the River games! There, should be a high score summit, for hearts! I would appreciate flags first of all, as an upgrade; number your upgrades as different upgrades! So, 1st thing you need to add are Statistics, Flags, and High-score tables that can be viewed by your users! You need to set dates for your upgrades for statistics and the like! Please, inform me that you have read this, and that you either like this/not?<br />\r\n <br />\r\nI BELIEVE, I JUST HEARD FROM THE Lord in my dreams last night! And for my meeting HIS Calling for me, here is my LATEST And GREATEST E-Mail, with pictures and EVERYTHING! If you want to read my upgrades, e-ml me there! It has Statistics in-depth, I will reply, with my Stored file, I call it pogo, statistics 7.73! See, I had dreams regarding this, and so, I have it SAVED for you! JUST ask, for this and you shall receive it! See, I KNOW It was the Lord, because He had me store this file under the name Statistics 7.73, just like He made the 7 days of the week! IF you will CREATE this file, you will BE BLESSED!!!!!!! I do not now HOW, but YOU WILL be blessed! JUST, Answer my calling, you will see the LORD, too! There, you shall be blessed! If, you create the following: 15 steps! That, is not much work for you now is it? I would hope not because I have spent many hours thinking of this creation for you! Create a message base for your help, too! This message base will be for suggestions by your users to play Hoyles cards, such as this user! Now, I will continue to Bless you with my ideas! But, I just will require the following to be programmed by Oct. 31, 2003! Create differing rated rooms for different Skill levels of play, and IF U play a card game, you will be placed Automatically, in the correct room! Just as you can calculate for each user ratings! I for see, different skill, levels and challenges to play at different times, on your given 7 days/wk. Still use The Happy jack, -10, option, because you can create a high score table with this in mind! Create various colored Flags that each user can give to each player if they would know each player! When you have this created you shall be able to envision more ideas and can expand your games under these ratings to More Fun filled games! Now, I would LIKE this to be programmed in this year, by Oct. 31, 2003, but can see it taking you an extended period of Time! So, because OF This, I will continue to give you these GREAT IDEAS until Christmas 2003! By then, I will no longer give you any more suggestions if you have not made these updates! But, I WILL continue to use your web site! Because, you still need other games such as Up N' Down the River.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nTo create A Recognition Page for ALL OF the helpers that helped in creating this, For this create a Banner page with my name first, with my telephone # posted on it, Brian E. Shepherd @ 513-367-6048, cincy2hot4u@hotmail.com, Scott Usher, Lexi, Tahd Frenzel, Patty Piranhaskark, FOX News!!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nI will go into DETAIL, about that game in a follow-up message, I send to you, see, my Steps I am working through, kinda-like Baby steps, I know you are not a baby, but I feel like I must feed you baby-bites or you will CHOKE! Remember, I AM A Part of your TEAM! Brand Spankin' new suggestion, deduct points for leavin' a table that they just won @ to help your steady players, who really get annoyed by winners that quit! So, for instance after a win, make them play again, if wanted to, because IF I win/lose I play until I lose, or have to go lift, eat, or go to bed! I think you should allow the winner to leave the game room a specific amount of games, 7 let's say, the limit 7, keep track of how many winners leave the pogo, rated room if they win n' leave after 7 times DEDUCT Ratings from the winner who does so! I get very TICKED at players who WIN A SINGLE Game and then LEAVE! I feel a warning message should persuade specific winners that IF they win again and keep quitting the room that they just won @ should play again, to reduce the # of FLUKE WINNERS! For, instance, I just lost a game, but I know that was a FLUKE loss, by me! If I were to code the loss factor into my game-code, I would figure out a way for fluke winners to NOT Quit! IF, A WINNER QUITS, after they win a game they should gain a limited amount, or something! Like, a winner who quits deduct 1 rating point from their rating, the 1st time they quit, 2, the second time, and create a surplus amount for a user who stays, a game after they win n' STAY, REDUCE 1 from their surplus after they quit, and warn them that after 7 wins, n' quits they should get a yellow flag associated by their user name! See, the awesomeness of a flagging system to warn others and me that they quit after a win, you should think up some way to keep winners around by giving them a Dark blue Flag! Or, A POSITIVE colored flag color! This option, I just thought up, because a winner left the game room! So, I thought up a way to use the color-coded flags! I want to get a gold star for this! LOLOLOLO, I do not even know how to keep a winner at a table, without a color-coded flag by their name! See, I should get some rewards for THINKING Up ALL this stuff for I want to get a blue colored flag associated with my name! This is associated to my game where the winner Flat out QUITS For NO reason! NOW, I have created, in my hurt mind, a way for a flagging system! I cannot fathom, why a player plays a completed game n' leaves after they win! You should create a number of times they win n' QUIT! They may be booted that is why I leave them a set number of quits, but if they surpass the set number of quits they will get a larger deduction if they continue to get the boot! Just think of a way to keep a player to lose rating points if they QUIT after a win, a certain # of times! Like, on the game--zone, IF you quit a game a specified # of games! You are welcome by the way for my THINKING Up these differing game RULES! Specify this update for me by telling me when is your target date for such an enhancement! See, I am THINKING In your behalf, UPDATES AND upgrades!!!!! I do not know, how, but I should get something for my ideas! I do not want money because that is the root of ALL-evil! Lololololo, just kidding! HOWEVER, PLS, Write a suggestion for me, if I want to go to school, again! PLEASE, Notre Dame, I do have some aspirations; I need to meet my Christian WIFE! I surely, am SMOOTH, by my creative thinking up different dating schemas like, The Create-A-Date, where the female gets to CREATE the date, the man just looks great and pays for this date, I went on a Create-a-Date where we went to the Park and I had to FIND THE Girl, and then she took me out to eat @ my favorite restaurant! She would leave me CLUES, after I followed up on ALL! I thought up a new for pogo! If you created a suggestion board for your users, where users are able to review idea AGAIN! I think that if you place me as head of the NEW IDEA Club, I would start other users' suggestions! Notre Dame should see, IDEAS of mine! I want to attend Notre Dame, for my graduate degree in Systems Analysis! I do not even know how, but I walk without aid of a wheelchair at all times and without need of a wheelchair, I feel is a GREAT accomplishment! I feel, with EA giving me recommendations, I could attend college anywhere!!! Maybe, I could show other users their quitting a game after a win Statistic! Because, They would get a yellow warning flag, for me, for quitting a room after they win/lose! See, another reason, for color coded flags, I was unaware of before now! Glad, I thought of that just as an inspirational thought!!!! I LOVE, The BOTH OF U2, for helping those in need, and POGO e-mailed me and said they are going to improve their statistics, which, I went, in-depth regarding this issue! So, I give my ideas from my ingenious mind, FREE! Jeff, I know this is not complete, cuz I do know that pogo, must add my game of both skill, n' great fortune, Up N' Down the River! So, when Electronic Arts finishes the addition of my statistics, I will send them the game rules to Up N' Down the River! So, how do you see giving a blue colored flag to the better player darken their flag for the # of + things they do for you, make a flag light yellow for the users that hamper your improvement! Does this help, your operators? IT Does ME! So, I could go to darker colored flags for any assistance I needed! THX, for using my ideas.<br />\r\n <br />\r\nMy history:<br />\r\n <br />\r\nI won homecoming king in my Harrison High School, Class of '89! Scored a Perfect score in the math portion of the ACT college entrance test, 36/36 possible! This is the reason, I am volunteering, these GREAT IDEAS To you! I know, I should have my name written on this software, but MY Heart, goes out to you!!!!!! (0-:} Get the hidden joke? He GAVE, his own life for you, n' I! See, Christian, point goes out to you! He DIED For you, and I, the ultimate SACRIFICE!!! I WILL leave, this coding up to U, The EA EXPERTS!!! If, you WANT for me, to give you any more specifics! If you need anything else from me, please e-mail me! So, I base my hearts and Bridge play on MATH!<br />\r\n <br />\r\nJesus LOVES U, N' I do too! 513-367-6048<br />\r\nMY GREATEST GOAL FOR POGO.COM, TO change their statistics!<br />\r\n <br />\r\n <br />\r\n&gt;From: education@mailbox.cps.intel.com<br />\r\n&gt;Reply-To: \"jennifer s\" &lt;education@mailbox.cps.intel.com&gt;<br />\r\n&gt;To: cincy2hot4u@hotmail.com<br />\r\n&gt;Subject: Help, please<br />\r\n&gt;Date: Wed, 22 Oct 2003 19:26:06 GMT<br />\r\n&gt;<br />\r\n&gt;Hello,<br />\r\n&gt;<br />\r\n&gt;Thank you for your interest in Intel.<br />\r\n&gt;<br />\r\n&gt;I'm very sorry, but we will be unable to assist with your inquiry.

The course is then presented as a mix of verbal instructions and actual click-and-see steps which emulate the behavior of Win2K as it walks you through performing all the steps in a particular objective.  At the end of the unit review questions are asked to reinforce what has been presented.  I haven't finished the first course yet, but I assume that at the end there is a sample test to approximate the real thing.  What a pleasure! <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 12px; height: 60px; padding: 5px\">\"The Lion shall lie down with the Lamb; <br>but the Lamb will not get much sleep...\" <br> Lazarus Long</div>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2003-07-03T17:23:00","modifiedDate":"2003-07-03T17:23:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2003-07-03T17:23:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/542435/Serebra-MCSE-Courses","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":542435,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"534650","title":"Search Engine","authors":[{"name":"Mr Siraj","id":445586}],"summary":"I would like to know the tools or programming languages needed to build our own search engine.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nPlz help to state the website to find the relevant info.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThanks alot<img src=\"https://codeproject.global.ssl.fastly.net/script/Forums/Images/smiley_redface.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Blush | :O\" />","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2003-06-25T21:09:00","modifiedDate":"2003-06-25T21:09:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2003-07-03T15:09:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/534650/Search-Engine","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":534650,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"542345","title":"Re: Search Engine","authors":[{"name":"Avery Moore","id":17017}],"summary":"You might want to ask this question in the Web Development or ASP.NET forums.","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2003-07-03T15:08:00","modifiedDate":"2003-07-03T15:08:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2003-07-03T15:09:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/542345/Re-Search-Engine","apiLink":"","parentId":534650,"threadId":534650,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"533255","title":"C# and VB.Net exam questions","authors":[{"name":"boro12","id":450929}],"summary":"Check out \"PocketPrep\" from handango.com.<br />\r\nIt has 90 questions based on the test spec.

Even so, a problem that might be solved in 10 minutes with someone in the next cubicle can take up to 2 days because of communication lag.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTasking - make sure you provide clear and detailed written requirements and design specs.

I would guess one or more of the following is going on:<br />\r\n<br />\r\n1. These individuals think they have written \"perfect\" code and other people are messing it up.<br />\r\n2. It could be that these guys are not that confident in what they have written and fear someone digging into their sloppy work.<br />\r\n3.

Have you discussed the problem directly with the individuals?  You might want to be pretty blunt about it, explaining that the developers need to work as a team and no one \"owns\" any portion of the code.  Tell them that you've noticed they get very upset when someone suggests changes to the code they have written.  If this is really a big problem, what's the worst that could happen - you might offend them and they might leave?  Would that be a bad thing?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n2. Is there another developer that these people would \"look up to\" and respect their opinions about code changes?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n3. Another option would be to solicit help from the person who wrote the initial code for suggestions on how any changes should be made (but make it clear that someone else will be making the changes).  \"Fred is going to be working on some new interfaces to the object you wrote, can you help give him some direction on how best to implement those changes.\"<br />\r\n<br />\r\n4.

(I probably wouldn't want to allow him to complain for a month though in the future.)<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHow's any of that strike you?  I'm not sure how these guys affect the overall atmosphere in the office, but even if they are the \"most productive\", you may need to consider whether overall production suffers because of them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nI know that my natural reaction is to be somewhat territorial with the code I've written, but I also realize I need other developers to make changes if all the work is going to be done that needs to be done.

It contains many sub-fields which you need to choose.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhat do you want to do: Front-end web-dev? Back-end web-dev? Graphic design? Standards and accessibility consultancy? Search engine optimisation? Contingency consultancy?<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for certification only two of those sub-fields really have any kind of applicable certification. Back-end web-dev is really just client/server development so you could get a MCSD or something similar. Graphic design you need to find an art college or industrial design school and get cert. from them.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThe other fields have no real certifications or courses to follow. Everything you learn is through experience, reading Zeldman and his band and figuring things out.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAlso don't get certification just because you feel like it would be cool or something. If clients are demanding it before they work with you, then fine go get something. <br />\r\nI don't have any certifications and am doing quite fine. At the end of the day it is what you produce that counts, not how many doctorates you have on the wall.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo decide which field of web-dev you are into, then come ask again <img src=\"https://www.codeproject.com/script/Forums/Images/smiley_smile.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Smile | :)\" />  <br />\r\n<br />\r\n<div style=\"padding-left: 36px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 10px; font-variant: ; font-weight: ; font-style: ; line-height: ; color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1); width: 200px; height: 40px; background-color: rgba(0, 51, 102, 1)\"><strong>Paul Watson</strong><br>Bluegrass<br>Cape Town, South Africa</div><br><small><b>Colin Davies wrote:</b></small><br />\r\n<i>...can you imagine a John Simmons stalker !</i>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-11-17T11:15:00","modifiedDate":"2002-11-17T11:15:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-11-22T18:04:00","rating":5.0,"votes":1,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/340102/Re-Need-advice","apiLink":"","parentId":339489,"threadId":339489,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"340554","title":"Re: Need advice","authors":[{"name":"Sarvesvara (BVKS) Dasa","id":49924}],"summary":"First of all... thanks for the real good reply for the abstract question I posted.

I have  been a Lan Administrator for 3 years ...I'm suddenly in a position to take on multiple tasks at my Job that involve programming . They are Tivoli(scripting mostly) , SQL ,VB,HTML,Oracle,Perl,Javascript.

Or can someone with my background make the switch ... mind you that I don't have a College degree but I have been to technical school .

Scripting is a dead-end, and most programmers don't even consider it programming. VB is okay, but generally doesn't pay as well as C++. Therefore, if you decide to follow my advice, brush up on databases by reading, experimenting (carefully! get advice from a DBA about setting up your own copy), and taking a few courses (if you can). If your company doesn't use C++, you could learn VB now and then learn C++ later. The good news is that once you learn one computer language, learning another is fairly easy.

We are primarily web development, but are getting into some application development as well.  I've used VSS before in a web environment and I was not impressed (this can be strictly because of the way it was implemented, so take it for what it's worth).  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nBasically, we had a VSS database on our shared development server.  Then, we would each do development on our own workstation.  When we checked a file in, it would be in the VSS database.  Next time someone went to work on the project, they would download all the changed files to their workstation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThere were some major flaws in this process in my mind: each workstation HAD to be configured identically in terms of directory structure, IIS settings, web process within IIS, etc.  One of the BIGGEST problems I saw was that each user had to create a web process in their own local IIS AND everytime a new COM object was built/changed, we would have to ensure all developers unregistered the old object and registered the new one.  Granted, this can all be accomplished with some batch files or scrpts, but that just seems like it shouldn't be necessary.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nIdeally, I'd like to have a single web process on a development server that we can develop against, but have some sort of source & version control & collaboration built in.  There must be a better way... and I'm sure someone has done it.  The trick is we want the same VSS solution to work for desktop app/client-server development (not the one development server... but just use a single source control).<br />\r\n<br />\r\nYour input would be greatly appreciated.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n-AC <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAndrew Connell<br />\r\nIM on MSN<br />\r\nandrew@aconnell.com","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-06-05T08:51:00","modifiedDate":"2002-06-05T08:51:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-06-27T19:09:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/200381/Implementing-VSS-in-a-web-based-environment","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":200381,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"220981","title":"Re: Implementing VSS in a web-based environment...","authors":[{"name":"Albert Pascual","id":33721}],"summary":"www.starbase.com","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-06-27T19:08:00","modifiedDate":"2002-06-27T19:08:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-06-27T19:09:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/220981/Re-Implementing-VSS-in-a-web-based-environment","apiLink":"","parentId":200381,"threadId":200381,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"200096","title":"Is it possible to do MCAD n MCSD in VC++.NET","authors":[{"name":"Faraz Ahmed Siddiqui","id":39116}],"summary":"Hi CPians <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'v seen the MCAD and MCSD courses but all the courses are offered in C# and VB.NET.<br />\r\nPlz! tell me if it is possible to do MCAD n MCSD in VC++ ot plz give me any links<br />\r\n<br />\r\nthanks<img src=\"https://www.codeproject.com/script/Forums/Images/smiley_confused.gif\" align=\"top\" alt=\"Confused | :confused:\" />  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nFaraz Ahmed Siddiqui<br />\r\nSoftware Engineer<br />\r\nKalSoft (Pvt) Ltd.

Often relocation includes the cost of the moving company, gas expenses for driving, sometimes temporary housing while you find a new house to buy, occasionaly even per dium (food, gas, etc. daily expenses). There's not really any strategy - it just comes down to how good your bargaining skills are, and whether or not you're bargaining from a position of power.

How hard you negotiate will ultimately come down to how strong you think your position is. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nHope this helps... <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChistopher Duncan<br />\r\nAuthor - <a href=\"http://www.ShowProgramming.com/TheCareerProgrammer.asp\">The Career Programmer: Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World (Apress)</a>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-03-18T07:51:00","modifiedDate":"2002-03-18T07:51:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-03-18T07:51:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/133778/Re-Relocation-Allowances","apiLink":"","parentId":133051,"threadId":133051,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"132020","title":"Are these useful sessions?","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Duncan","id":29452}],"summary":"I'm getting into the speaking / seminar end of things, and I'm kicking around ideas for some additional sessions. The four that I'm teaching on an upcoming developers conference are all more closely related to the actual development process, and they cover requirements gathering, design, estimating and QA. No problem so far, the feedback I get tells me that programmers are interested in this sort of stuff. However, there are other things that I personally think are critical if you work in the business world and I'd like to do sessions on them as well. Before I invest any time trying to put them together, though, I could use some feedback as to whether programmers would actually be interested enough to make it worthwhile. Here's some of the things I'm thinking about -<br />\r\n<br />\r\nInterviewing skills:<br />\r\nI've hired a lot of people over the years, and it's amazing the basic stuff that doesn't seem to be common knowledge among applicants. A lot of programmers think that their technical skills are all that matters, but in fact, it's only one small part of getting the gig. I'm thinking that this type of session would probably more important to mercenaries who change jobs a lot than to someone who gets a gig and keeps it for 5 years, but I could be wrong.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCoping with company politics:<br />\r\nProgrammers don't want to do anything but code, really. However, most of the times we get screwed (somebody else got the sexy project, the raise, the office with a door, Bad Things happened to your project, etc.) it's because somebody else played the politics game well, and we didn't (or worse still, didn't even want to try). <br />\r\n<br />\r\nCreating your own projects:<br />\r\nThis would more accurately be \"learning how to sell your ideas to management\", but put the word \"sell\" in a title and watch the programmers run for the door. Nonetheless, I've extended a lot of contracts at cool companies because I pitched them on a project I wanted to develop, and they went for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThese are a few of what I have in mind. There's more along these lines. I know, I know, it ain't techie and sexy like \"Learn ASP.NET in 24 Minutes!\" but there's a lot of <i>really</i> top notch guys doing that sort of thing already. I know from years of personal experience that programmers' lives would be better if they had these skills, but do you think anyone would actually go to sessions like this? If you do, are there other such ideas that working class programmers would see a need for? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIn the end, it doesn't matter how cool or useful a session is unless people will actually sign up for it. I don't want to burn up all my midnight oil on a project unless it has some chance of being useful. You guys are the real programmers out there making a living. I figure you're a good reality check...<br />\r\n<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChistopher Duncan<br />\r\nAuthor - <a href=\"http://www.ShowProgramming.com/TheCareerProgrammer.asp\">The Career Programmer: Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World (Apress)</a>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-03-14T20:52:00","modifiedDate":"2002-03-14T20:52:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-12-10T17:00:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/132020/Are-these-useful-sessions","apiLink":"","parentId":0,"threadId":132020,"indentLevel":0},{"id":"132034","title":"Re: Are these useful sessions?","authors":[{"name":"Michael A.

Screw with my money just once, and you'll be trying to teach your Cocker Spanial to debug the code that's left behind. No money - no coding. Period. If you don't pay me what I'm owed, on precisely the agreed upon dates, you'll never even know there's a problem until you wake up one day and I'm simply not there. If you give people like this fair warning, they'll try to make life difficult for you every time. If you can't trust them on something as fundamental as money, you can't trust them at all.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<small><b>A CP Regular wrote:<br />\r\n</b></small><i>Now I've got this wacky idea that maybe I should just start up my own business</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nWell, if you can afford the financial gamble, I'd say go for it. Just be advised that <b>all</b> startups are a huge risk. The mortality rate for first year business failures is extremely high. Nonetheless, many have done so and succeeded. I owned a software company for several years in the early 90s. I didn't get rich, but I made a decent living on my own terms.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThey say that you shouldn't start a business unless you can go without income for the first year (that's not as extreme as you might think). Can you? If not, you're rolling the dice on your ability to eat and pay the rent. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nOf course, an additional option is to simply get another job - one that pays you on time, without question. Start up your new company on the side, in your spare time. When it can pay your bills, make the transition. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs for maintaining business relationships with your current employer, ask yourself this question - if it's hard to get payment on time now, when you're there every day, how much harder is it going to be to get your invoices paid when he's a customer? In other words, what, are you nuts? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nIf you don't depend on the money you get from programming to pay your bills and eat, then screw this guy and write code that you want to write, just for the fun of it. If you do depend on the money you make as a programmer, then screw this guy and quietly go out and find another job. Why quietly? No point terminating one source of income until you have another to replace it. There is no dishonor in self defense. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd just for the record, while it's true that I'm a mercenary and will never play fair with those who don't play fair with me, I also believe in living and working with honor and integrity. When I take a gig, I give them 100% (sometimes more) and always do my best to act ethically and in the company's best interests. When it's time to go (happens sooner or later no matter how good the gig is), I make sure they have notice and are taken care of, and leave the door open for them to call me at home after I'm gone if they're in a jam with my code. That's always paid off for me. In the past 12 years, I've only had to cover my tail a couple of times. The rest has been an exercise in good karma - they treat me right, and I bend over backwards to take good care of them. And the other couple of times? Well, the details certainly aren't on my resume. One thing you can count on, though. I sure didn't give them fair warning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nThat's the problem with this business. Lots of absolutely killer programmers out there, but many of them don't know how to cover their tails in the business world. I just hate seeing honest and talented people get taken advantage of. Perhaps it shows...<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSo, how's <i>that</i> for long? <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChistopher Duncan<br />\r\nAuthor - <a href=\"http://www.ShowProgramming.com/TheCareerProgrammer.asp\">The Career Programmer: Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World (Apress)</a>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-03-14T20:28:00","modifiedDate":"2002-03-14T20:28:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-03-16T09:25:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/132010/Re-Taking-the-plunge","apiLink":"","parentId":131961,"threadId":131961,"indentLevel":1},{"id":"132129","title":"Re: Taking the plunge","authors":[{"name":"","id":0}],"summary":"<small><b>Christopher Duncan wrote:<br />\r\n</b></small><i>You're a helluva lot nicer guy than I am, I'll give you that.

In this business, continuing education is always a Good Thing.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHowever, that having been said, there are two reasons that I don't personally pursue certifications. The first is simply a matter of practicality. There are only so many hours in the day, which for me are usually filled with an array of side projects (many of which are resume enhancing). At least in my environment, certifications just don't bring enough to the party in terms of improving my career options to justify the amount of time that they take to achieve. When it comes time to look for a new gig, my searches have always comes down to the interview and whether or not I have actual job experience with the little bits of technology that a client needs at the moment. For the most part, what I see on the streets is that employers (at least in my neck of the woods) don't put a lot of stock in certification programs, Microsoft or otherwise. And everyone who's done any hiring knows that people fresh out of college with no practical experience beyond a BSCS are going to have to be shown most everything in the beginning. Employers are looking for experience in the real world.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFrankly I must say, with no disrespect towards the many excellent programmers I've known who also have degrees &amp; certs, that I can understand the employer's point of view. I have worked with many programmers who had a vast collection of certifications on their resume and in the end, not to be unkind, they couldn't find their posterior with both hands and a flashlight. A clueless programmer with a certificate is still a clueless programmer (and make no mistake, clueless programmers can still pass the cert exams - I've met them). The same applies to college degrees. I've seen people with more degrees on their resume than the you could shake a stick at. These were highly, highly educated individuals who were clearly much more intelligent than my little uneducated self, and yet they were an absolute disaster to the projects they were on. Couldn't code their way out of a wet paper bag. In fact (I wish now I had printed it out), one of the most convoluted functions I've ever seen was from someone who had both a gazillion degrees and certifications. It was about 20 lines of C++ where literally every line (not counting the curly braces) was incorrect, in sometimes bizarre ways. And it was all to replace atol(), which he didn't even know existed. And yet, on paper, this guy was an absolute stud.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMake no mistake here, my point is not to show disrespect towards those capable and qualified programmers who have degrees and / or certifications. Rather, it's to point out that nothing takes the place of practical experience, and employers know this. I frequently have people come to me and express a desire to become a programmer, asking where they should start, which college courses, certification programs, etc. My response is probably unprofessional and unconventional, but I tell them to save that money and spend it instead on books and a compiler. You'll get up to speed and get a job in a much, much shorter time frame, you'll spend more time actually coding, and frankly, if they have to go back to college every time they need to learn a new technology or API, they're toast in this business anyway. Things change too quickly. You have to be able to pick it up on your own.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMind you, all of this must be taken in the context of where I live, the US. I have friends from India who have told me that the job market is so tight there you can hardly get a job flipping burgers without at least a BS. And I have no experience in other countries, either. So above all, it's a matter of doing what's practical for your own environment. In the US, however, those who spend their nights lit by the glow of a monitor as they bang out code are able to compete favorable in the market with their degreed and certified brethren. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nWhile I'm sure that there's tons of people here with a long educational pedigree, I suspect that there are also quite a few who got into this business with no formal education whatsoever and have successful careers that came from nothing more than late nights with a compiler. We're extremely fortunate that we can get away with that in this business. You'll never be able to get a gig as a lawyer or accountant like that...<br />\r\n <br />\r\n<br />\r\nChistopher Duncan<br />\r\nAuthor - <a href=\"http://www.ShowProgramming.com/TheCareerProgrammer.asp\">The Career Programmer: Guerilla Tactics for an Imperfect World (Apress)</a>","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-03-07T07:19:00","modifiedDate":"2002-03-07T07:19:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-03-07T12:34:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/127471/Re-MCP","apiLink":"","parentId":127256,"threadId":123195,"indentLevel":3},{"id":"127685","title":"Re: MCP","authors":[{"name":"AndyG","id":13327}],"summary":"<small><b>Christopher Duncan wrote:<br />\r\n</b></small><i>A clueless programmer with a certificate is still a clueless programmer (and make no mistake, clueless programmers can still pass the cert exams - I've met them).</i><br />\r\n<br />\r\nClueless people are a fact of life and somehow they get degrees and certifications.  I'd also say a lot of clueless people have don't have degress or certifications.  Unfortunately the certification exams aren't foolproof and it is fairly easy to cheat.  But it will catch up to them someday when they go in for a technical interview and the hiring manager decides to bring in a few members of the team to ask some questions...  <br />\r\n<br />\r\nI'm also in the US and got my start in an unconventional manner, but I think here is where we start to differ.  I've only been a professional developer for about 3 years now so as far as salary, I'm still on my way up.  I also work in a corporate environment as opposed to consulting.  While my immediate supervisor does not put a lot of weight into certifications, he does put weight into learning new skills and becoming better at the skills you already have.  So when its time for performance reviews my supervisor knows where I'm coming from and understands the situation, but what reason does he give his supervisor on why he is asking for X amount of dollars for Andy's review?  Instead of saying \"Andy done real good at learning the SQL Server!  Give him more money!\" he can say \"Andy has the MCDBA certification, and that means he knows SQL Server.\".  Our reviews aren't based solely on certs, but the more ammunition, the better.  And on one hand I could have learned SQL Server inside and out, not gotten certified, jumped to a new job and that would have definately affected my marketable skills and in turn affect salary.  But I'm happy with my current job, and if certification helps my boss tell his boss that I'm worth it, then I'm all for it.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nCertifications don't make me better than anyone, but the amount of effort I put into doing what I love does. <br />\r\n<br />\r\nAndy Gaskell, MCSD MCDBA","contentType":"ForumMessage","docType":{"name":"Forum Message","id":6},"categories":[],"tags":[],"license":{"name":null,"id":0},"createdDate":"2002-03-07T12:16:00","modifiedDate":"2002-03-07T12:16:00","threadEditor":{"name":null,"id":0},"threadModifiedDate":"2002-03-07T12:34:00","rating":0.0,"votes":0,"popularity":0.0,"websiteLink":"https://www.codeproject.com/Messages/127685/Re-MCP","apiLink":"","parentId":127471,"threadId":123195,"indentLevel":4},{"id":"127689","title":"Re: MCP","authors":[{"name":"Christopher Duncan","id":29452}],"summary":"Well said, and a good point.
